We also propose to reinstate Roosevelt (Gordonesroo). The rapid migration process from Ethereum meant his membership & voting rights were inaccessible.\nIncreasing the total number of members reduces the voting power of any individual member while also increasing the minimum total number of voters required for any vote to pass. This will prioritise voter participation as a necessity for the DAO's continued function. \n\n\n### Proposal:\n\nI propose to add Chidi & Gordonesroo to ZecHub DAO. As ZecHub DAO members they will be expected to participate in governance discussions, and vote on open proposals.\n\n\n### Action:\n\nA vote of \"Yes\" supports adding new member Chidi and reinstating Roosevelt's voting membership.",

It is the final step required for our store to be fully operational. This can be paid using cryptocurrency. The advantage of this is the DAO operates transparently with visibility into funds received from store orders (Zcash donation address) & amounts approved for order fulfilment. \n\n\n### Proposal:\n\nWe propose to convert $250 in assets from the DAO treasury to allocate towards order fulfilment for the ZecHub Store.   \n\n**Process** -\nThis proposal consists of 2 actions:\n\n1. Spend 16.35 WAVAX from the DAO treasury into ZecHub.osmo address\n2. Spend 690 Juno from DAO treasury into ZecHub.juno address \n\n(ZecHub ICNS addresses are controlled by zksquirrel).\n\nFunds will then be converted into Ethereum (ETH) and used to pay an invoice for order fulfilment. \n\n\n### Action:\n\nA vote of \"Yes\" supports withdrawing 2 assets from DAO Treasury towards order fulfilment for ZecHub.store. \n",

      "description": "**1. Background**\n\nJason McGee is proposing a collaborative project involving Shielded Labs, ZecHub, and possibly QEDIT. This project aims to create a series of informative and educational video explainers on Zcash Shielded Assets (ZSAs). The project's primary goal is to raise awareness, educate users and builders, and stimulate interest in ZSAs. \n\n**2.  Rationale**\n\nQEDIT is developing the underlying technology for ZSAs; however, it is also essential to find both users and developers interested in leveraging ZSAs for various applications, including private stablecoins, Bitcoin, and NFTs.\n\nThe proposed video explainers will serve a dual purpose. First, they will explain the concept of ZSAs and their functionality, acting as educational and informational materials for a broad audience. Second, these videos will function as marketing tools, creating excitement and interest in the project while crafting a narrative about potential use cases for ZSAs. Effective marketing will attract not only users but also developers interested in building on this technology.\n\n**3. Proposal**\n\nShielded Labs will be responsible for research and writing, and ZecHub will handle video production and animation, though cross-collaboration is welcome. Jason is seeking the approval of the DAO for this project since financial resources from the DAO’s treasury will need to be used to cover expenses related to content creation and production.  We will start with one video explainer. The amount from the DAO's treasury to support this effort will be capped at the ZEC equivalent of USD $200.  \n\nIf this proposal is approved, the next step will be for Shielded Labs and ZecHub to reach out to QEDIT for their feedback and to see if they are interested in collaborating.  \n\n**4. Action**\n\nA vote of “Yes” supports using funds from the treasury to support this project as specified above.  \n\n\n**5. About**\n\nShielded Labs is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Zcash founded by Jason McGee of Zcash Community Grants. Its mission is to increase user adoption, develop new use cases for Zcash, and contribute to protocol development. Shielded Labs was established with two goals in mind: to increase decentralization by independently contributing to the ongoing development of Zcash, and to make Zcash more resilient by building a geographically diverse and robust ecosystem. Shielded Labs is domiciled in Switzerland, a country that is crypto-friendly and has a long-standing tradition of safeguarding privacy rights. \n\nQEDIT specializes in ZKP engineering for distributed systems and has been building Asset Transfer Systems employing privacy for both public and private blockchains.  QEDIT has received two grants from Zcash Community Grants to build Zcash Shielded Assets.  You can learn more about their project here: https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-proposal-for-shielded-assets-zsa-uda-for-defi-on-zcash/40520 \n",

The project has been in operation for 8 months & continues on track to end in December. \n\n## Why:\nSupplementing ZecHub treasury will significantly increase longevity of the project.\n\nUntil this stage ZecHub has served as a useful proof of concept for the community. We have demostrated the ability, talent and enthusiasm of existing Zcash community members + newly attracted contributors to build on Zcash. \n\nAn extension of the treasury dedicated to bounties would allow for ZecHub to scale and be improved upon. \n\nThis is ideal timing with low price of ZEC. The treasury would be able to dynamically adjust price of tasks and produce more, higher quality content. \n\n## Proposal:\nWe propose to request an amount $7000 from the Zcash Foundation Minor Grants. If successful this amount will be awarded in ZEC and received to the projects Zcash Treasury.\n\nRead Zcash Minor Grants Proposal: https://app.skiff.com/docs/df4d7d36-3509-4ed3-9f9d-add23247f955#5Mt5xn%2Ba8me74BitGi%2FMm9J%2BzAWsAYwTyTIi9XiL2Gg%3D\n\n## Action:\nA vote of \"Yes\" supports posting the proposal to Zcash Community Forum for Community discussion and ZCAP vote.

      "description": "This proposal was to establish a value for creating tasks for members of SubDao Zcash Design to create CC (Close Captions) files in other languages to upload on ZecHub's YouTube and have official subtitles in several languages.\n\nDao would vote for the most relevant videos by selecting them and each member would have the option to choose to make a maximum of one CC per month, at first. Being paid $10 in Juno for a file up to 5 minutes long and $15 for files longer than 5 minutes successfully delivered.\n\nThis proposal will be valid for February and March, considering that it is a test to collect the first results of this operation, and it will be necessary to submit a new proposal to continue with the work or readjust its details.\n\nThis way the community can evaluate metrics and see if it is worth continuing with this operation.\n\nClose Captions Youtube explanation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB9ql0L0cUQ&t=105s\n\nI aim with this proposal:\n- Help Ambassadors' Social Media to promote content with official Dao translations, improving synergy between accounts in the Zcash ecosystem.\n- Bring accessibility to material produced by DAO contributors.\n- Bring people from new languages to contribute with us and join to SubDAO/DAO.",

I have been active in the community for a few years now and think this will be a good step to be more involved in the Zcash ecosystem and weigh in with my ideas or knowledge of media stuff. I’ve been most active in the ZFAV club supporting activities and also giving feedback on most of Zcash ecosystem products and wallets etc. I’m from Northern Europe so that adds another part of the world to ZecHub DAO. \n\nProposal:\n\nI propose to add Zerodartz (me) to the DAO.

In that time he has contributed significantly to the Zcash ecosystem through personal projects such as zlink.click and more officially as a Zcash Global Ambassador, managing the Zcash IT telegram channel and through the creation of [Zcash AI](https://x.com/zcashai) X account. \n\n### Why:\n\nDue to time constraints from other projects Olek is actively involved in, he has requested to step down from a governance role in the DAO. \n\n### Proposal:\n\nThis proposal is to remove Olek from ZecHub DAO. Additionally, the DAO will assist in transfer and continuation of Zcash AI.\n\n### Action:\n\nA vote of \"Yes\" is in favour of removing Olek as DAO member.\n\n\n# Proposal 2 - Update Voting Config (Multiple Choice)\n\n\n### Background: \n\nMultiple Choice voting was enabled to allow ZecHub DAO to carry out polls. The current configuration is set to 1 week, this is not ideal as multiple questions are normally included in a poll. \n\n### Why:\n\nDAO polls can be purposed toward matters beyond ZecHub governance, serving as one of many options that can be offered in determining Zcash Community Consensus on any number of topics. \n\n\n### Proposal:\n\nReduce Multiple Choice voting period from 1 Week to 1 Day.\n\n\n### Action:\n\nUpdate Voting Configuration to reduce Multiple Choice voting period from 1 Week to 1 Day.\n\n\n",

      "description": "### Background:\n\nThe ZecHub Bounty Program has focused primarily on documentation and graphic design that contributes to Zcash education. It has recently began issuing tasks for development on the ZecHub wiki. This initiative has been very successful in offering utility and network information. \n\n### Why:\n\nZecHub Bounty Program exists to advance Zcash education. Allowing developers access to Zcash nodes without having to invest in hardware and time necessary for syncing will improve our Bounty Program's ability to create video content, documentation and demonstrate new Zcash use cases. There are also a relatively low number of zcashd nodes and Zebra nodes in operation, this proposal will contribute to Zcash network stability and resilience. \n\n\n### Proposal:\n\nZecHub DAO run Zcashd Full Nodes operating on Distributed Infrastructure via Akash Network. Approximate Cost to run a zcashd node is $30 per month. A framework has been created to provide community members a means to register and access the nodes. An amount $360 will cover deployment fees for 2 Nodes during a 6 month timeframe. DAO members & Community members will have access to the deployment account upon request. \n\nFramework Link: https://github.com/ZecHub/zechub/blob/main/site/contribute/Build_on_Zcash.md \n\n\n### Action:\n\nBy voting \"Yes\" you approve withdrawal of 18 ZEC from the ZecHub ZEC Donations address to fund the ZecHub Community Infra account.

And some community members indicated to me that it would be a good idea for the activity to be partially funded by ZecHub, and partially funded by ZCG.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe total amount requested by me to the ZCG was 10,000 USD, but I have done a thorough review and adjustment of the proposal, to try to keep the costs as low as possible.\n\n**The readjustment of the proposal was 7,000 USD.**\n\nAnd I would like to request the support of ZecHub with 50% of this proposal, that is, with 3,500 USD. The rest of the proposal I will restate to the ZCG.\n\nI believe that with this new budget we can carry out the activity.\n\n## Action\n\nVote Yes to approve this proposal for **3500 USD** for the Generation Z Youth Educational Camp.\n\n\n",

      "description": "## General Overview\nThis proposal outlines our approach to developing a user-friendly and secure testnet ZEC faucet for the Zcash Developer community. \nWith a proven track record of delivering similar high-profile projects, our team possesses the required expertise and a deep understanding of the complexities of building secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure.\n\n## Background and Experience\nWe are experienced professionals specialized in blockchain and NFT projects:\n\n- Johnpaul Chiwetelu - Full Stack Developer (6 years experience)\n- James Harrison  - Smart Contract Specialist (5 years experience)\n- Mecha Samuel - UX/UI Designer (5 years experience)\n\n### Relevant Contributions by Team Members\n- ECF Network: Ethereum Community Fund (ecf.network)\n- World Bridge Linea: https://github.com/kfastov/worldcoin-bridge-linea\n- Oku: https://oku.kodesage.xyz/\n- Konnadex: https://www.konnadex.com/\n- AssetChian Faucet: https://faucet.assetchain.org/\n- Grapes NFT marketplace: GRAPE NFT Marketplace (grapes.network)\n- Osmosis: Osmosis\n- Passage NFT Staking Audit\n- Passage NFT Staking Dashboard (Ongoing)\n\n### Other Web3 Contributions\n- [Floor NFTs](https://floor.fun)\n- [Stellar Documentation](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs)\n- [Starknet Scaffold](https://github.com/horuslabsio/Starknet-Scaffold)\n\n## Approach and Methodology\nOur approach is divided into 6 main components to deliver a secure, user-friendly ZEC testnet faucet:\nDiscovery and Planning: We'll start by deeply understanding ZecHub's goals for the faucet, the needs of Zcash developers, and how it fits into the broader ecosystem. Through collaboration with the ZecHub DAO, we'll align on project requirements, define success criteria, and establish a shared vision.\n\n**UX and UI Design**:\n\nOur user-centric design process will focus on creating an intuitive interface that makes it easy for developers to request and receive testnet ZEC. The frontend will be visually appealing while prioritizing security. A RECAPTCHA mechanism will be integrated to ensure DDOS attacks are mitigated. The backend will ensure limits are set per wallet address per day and implement any other limits requested by the DAO.\n\n**Development and Integration**:\n\n The faucet will be built using modern, secure web technologies. We'll develop the user-facing features first, including ZEC request forms, and DOS protections. Integration with a Zcash testnet node will follow, adhering to security best practices. All code will be thoroughly reviewed and tested.\n\n**Testing and Quality Assurance**:\n\nRigorous testing will be conducted throughout development, spanning unit tests, integration tests, and comprehensive end-to-end testing. The faucet will be tested on multiple devices, operating systems, and browsers to ensure broad compatibility. Any identified issues will be swiftly resolved and re-tested before launch.\n\n**Documentation**: \n\nWe'll provide detailed documentation for faucet users and future developers. User guides will walk developers through the ZEC request process and any associated best practices. Technical documentation will cover the faucet architecture, deployment instructions, and additional integration details. \n\n**Launch and Ongoing Support**:\n\n We'll coordinate closely with the ZecHub DAO to prepare for a successful faucet launch. This will include final pre-launch testing, deployment to production infrastructure, and post-launch monitoring. After the initial release, we'll provide ongoing support and maintenance for at least 6 months to swiftly address any issues that arise and keep the faucet running smoothly.\n\n\n\n## Cost Estimate and Fee Breakdown\nTotal Estimated Cost: **$7, 000 (150 ZEC)**\n\n\nWe are open to receiving payments upon completion of each major milestone, with an initial deposit to kick off development. All payments will be made in shielded ZEC transactions.\n\n## Breakdown:\n- UI/UX Design and Research: **30 ZEC**\n- Faucet Development and Zcash Node Integration: **80 ZEC**\n- Testing and Documentation: **40 ZEC**\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n**Week One(1)**\n\n- Conduct UX research and create wireframes\n- Design UI for key views (ZEC Request Form, Request Confirmation, Errors and Security Check)\n- Begin faucet frontend development\n- Plan testnet node integration and ZEC distribution logic\n- Start drafting user guide and technical documentation\n\n\n**Week Two(2)**\n\n- Finalize UI design and hand it off to development\n- Implement ZEC request form with input validation and error handling\n- Develop backend logic for processing and tracking ZEC requests\n- Implement ZEC distribution from the testnet node based on approved requests\n- Add DOS prevention measures like rate limiting and CAPTCHAs\n- Continue writing user and technical documentation\n\n**Week Three(3)**\n\n- Integrate real-time testnet node status monitoring (status page)\n- Conduct thorough testing of ZEC request flows\n- Perform security review of faucet implementation\n- Optimize frontend performance and loading speeds\n- Complete the initial draft of the user guide and technical docs\n- Perform UX review and incorporate feedback\n\n**Week Four(4)**\n\n- Resolve any remaining bugs or issues\n- Conduct additional device/browser testing\n- Finalize and polish all faucet features\n- Optimize DOS prevention based on testing\n- Complete user and technical documentation\n- Deploy faucet to production infrastructure\n- Open-source faucet codebase on GitHub\n- Deliver project to ZecHub DAO\n\n## Deliverables\n- Fully functional, user-friendly ZEC testnet faucet\n- Secure integration with Zcash testnet node for ZEC distribution\n- Comprehensive DOS prevention and security measures\n- Detailed user guide explaining faucet usage and best practices\n- Technical documentation covering:\n- System architecture\n- Deployment instructions\n- Additional integration details\n- Polished codebase open-sourced on GitHub\n- QA report detailing testing methodology and results\n\nOur team's deep expertise in web3 development, combined with a robust approach that prioritizes usability, security, and testing, will result in a successful testnet faucet for the Zcash community.\nBy focusing the UX on developer needs, implementing strong security and DOS prevention, and providing ample documentation, the faucet will be well-equipped to support the growing Zcash developer ecosystem.\nWe look forward to collaborating with the ZecHub DAO to bring this important community resource to fruition. Our demonstrated skills and shared commitment to Zcash's principles of privacy and education make us the ideal partner for this project.\n\n## Action:\n\nA vote of \"Yes\" supports posting the proposal to Zcash Community Forum for Community discussion and ZCAP vote.\n",

All details regarding our progress will be shared on the forum in 10 days.\nTo follow us:\n\n🔗 https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-global-turkish-2025/49932/20\n\nWhen submitting the proposal, we did not request an event budget, but upon careful consideration, we realized that this might create challenges for us. Therefore, we would like to seek support from Zechub to request a smaller event budget compared to other communities.\n\n📌 Total event budget request for 2 months: $600\n\nThe requested budget will be used for social media events & local coffee meetups. Records and invoices for all events and competitions will be shared transparently.\n\nThank you for supporting our progress. In the second quarter of 2025, with the arrival of summer, you will see a much larger Turkish community. We also plan to organize many more events!\n\nBest regards :)",

      "description": "Zcash Korea Ambassador Proposal\nAiden Jeon\nFebruary 2025\n\nIntroduction\n\nHello everyone,\n\nMy name is Aiden Jeon, and I have been working as a Zcash Korea Ambassador for the past few years. Despite being less active last year due to professional commitments, I have continued to manage and engage with the Zcash Korea community through various platforms, including KakaoTalk, Telegram, and Twitter (X).\n\nRecently, there have been significant updates in the Zcash ecosystem. However, the lack of Korean-language updates has made it challenging for Korean community members to stay informed. I believe that by addressing this issue, we can foster a stronger and more engaged Zcash community in Korea.\n\n\nProposal\n\nIf given the opportunity, I will actively enhance communication, share important updates, and grow the Zcash Korea community through strategic engagement and content distribution. My plan includes:\n\nProviding timely Korean translations of Zcash updates\nIncreasing community interaction via social media and chat platforms\nOrganizing events and discussions to drive engagement and awareness\n\n\nCompensation & Budget\n\nTo ensure consistent and high-quality contributions, I propose the following compensation structure for an initial three-month period (February – April):\nMonthly Fee: $400\nTotal Budget (USD): $1,200\n\nCurrent Zcash Korea Community Metrics\n\nTwitter (X): Follower 994 → https://x.com/zaos1004\nKakaoTalk: 307 members → https://open.kakao.com/o/gGDr99Ld\nNaver Cafe/Blog: 278 members → https://cafe.naver.com/zcashcommunity\nTelegram: 151 members → https://t.me/KoreaZcashCommunity\n\nWith this support, I am confident that we can strengthen the Zcash presence in Korea and build a more connected, informed, and engaged community.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to contributing further to the growth of Zcash in Korea.\n\nBest regards,\nAiden Jeon",

      "description": "I want to officially present this proposal - pioneering the ‘DYK Series’ and being saddled with more responsibilities as an in-house Designer with Zechub.\n\nBackground: \n\nMy name is Kroy, I am a Graduate Architect, ZecHub Design SubDAO member and professional Graphic Designer (7+ experience with Adobe CC proficiency) expertise in Brand Identity Design and minimal Illustrations. \n\nlink to my portfolio - https://www.behance.net/theKroy\n\nI have been with the Zechub community for over a year now (joined on the 6th of February, 2024) and it has been amazing so far with the community; interacting, learning more about Zcash, earning $ZEC via bounties, contributing to My First Zcash, and so much more. I have enjoyed EVERY bit of it.\n\nIn my time as a contributor I have designed;\nEduZEC Brand Visual Identity and Logo\nthe current X header\nthe previous retro X header\nIsometric assets for zechub.wiki\npartneship posters\nother informative posters\n\nHowever, even with how much I have done within the community I just feel I haven’t done enough, I know I have so much to offer the community, there’s this dissatisfaction that I just can’t ignore.\n.\n\nProposal:\n\nZcash & ZecHub ‘Did-You-Know (DYK)’ Series - a weekly informative and educational series that will run all through the year to help Zechub community members, $ZEC enthusiasts and the general audience know more about Zcash & ZecHub in the most creative, informative, minimal and fun way.\n\nAs I want to maintain industry design standards, perfect consistency and at the same time learn more about Zcash I’d love to take the responsibilities of scouting these said facts, creating an editable template and then editing this template to keep up with the series\n\nAs Zechub is growing and growing quickly, the bounty program is still up with many more creatives from around the world coming in. I could take a step back from applying for bounties so that they could be assigned to more creatives to help the community grow even bigger.\n\nI want to take up the responsibilities of being an inhouse designer, I would take on design tasks that do not get to be posted on Dework but it is expedient that they are done (Zero to Zero Knowledge poster for example) and also make quick edits to design errors or make improvements to designs that have been submitted from a bounty task. \n\nResponsibilities:\n\n- Create two editable template for the DYK Series (one for ZecHub and one for Zcash)\n- Research interesting and educative facts for the DYK Series (see example of draft facts below)\n- Create editable template for Zero-to-Zero Knowledge Poster and edit accordingly every time a post needs to go up\n- Make corrections to poster design submissions via the bounty program when the need arises\n- Make designs for peculiar milestone events (for example; making 3k+ followers, 4th of July, Merry Christmas e.t.c)\n- Make designs for ZecHub/Zcash that don’t make it to the Dework\n- Attend weekly syncs and give prompt updates of every progress \n- Be Innovative and creative with ideas and designs suggestions that can help how the general audience sees Zechub from a design standpoint \n\n\nExample of Planned Work:\n\nDYK Series (Draft)\n\n- Zcash\n\n- You can receive Zcash Shielded Payments to your Wordpress Store or Business using the Zgo Payment Processor.\n- Zcash makes use of zero-knowledge proofs; This means amounts and addresses held on desktop/mobile are never revealed on chain, only a proof that the transaction is valid. This is known as Client-Side validation.\n- Zcash launched on October 28, 2016, after a successful crowdfunding campaign that raised over $1 million.\n- Zcash Unified Addresses can contain any combination of Orchard, Sapling and Transparent receivers with a condition at least one Shielded receiver is included.\n- Zcash has a block time of just 75 seconds, faster & more private than Litecoin! This means that on average it takes 75 seconds to send or receive money privately wherever you are..\n\n\nZechub\n\n- ZecHub is a community-driven platform that connects Zcash enthusiasts, developers, creatives and investors.\n- Zechub operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO); it is ran by community members who collaborate to the best interest of the community at large.\n- The ZecHub community is growing rapidly, it now consists of 2k+ Discord members, 2k+ X Followers & 500+ Youtube Subscribers.\n- Zechub was formed in 2022 by Janusz\n- Zechub encourages inclusivity; the community boasts ambassadors in various countries of the world spreading the Zcash and privacy gospel.\n\n\n \nLink to Proposed Templates https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-2bq1EyEdvqPD0Q6MW6bIuRR2sKVJ55g\n\n\n\nTimeline\nDuration of ZecHub 2025 (1 Year)\n\n\n\nAction: \n\nBy voting ‘Yes’ you are in favor of the DYK project, assigning Kroy the Designer role and the disbursement of $350 ($300 as remuneration and $50 to cover adobe cc and design assets website subscriptions) on a monthly basis. \n\n",

      "description": "\n## Introduction: Background and relevant experience.\n\nSoftware Engineer with 8 years’ professional experience working in web and app development. Extensive expertise in building full-stack apps, design systems and server management; most experienced with JavaScript and Java, familiar with the Rust ecosystem and have experience with Python. Founder of open-source organization [Elemental Design: Elemental Design System](https://github.com/elemental-design), [Elemental Zcash: Zcash Design System](https://github.com/elemental-zcash) and [Elemental Pay: Open-source Cryptocurrency Payment Processing Apps and Utilities](https://github.com/elemental-pay).\n\nDeveloped Elemental Zcash, an open-source design system and component library for Zcash apps. As part of this, I created an experimental [Zingo Node.js library](https://github.com/elemental-zcash/zingo-node) – a JSON RPC interface for creating payment invoices and authenticating via Zcash memos.\n\nContributed to Free2Z by developing a redesign of the [search](https://github.com/free2z/zuu/blob/main/ts/react/free2z/src/components/FindSearchFilter.tsx) and [profile pages](https://github.com/free2z/zuu/blob/main/ts/react/free2z/src/components/DisplayCreator.tsx), together with a [table of contents](https://github.com/free2z/zuu/blob/main/ts/react/free2z/src/components/markdown/TableOfContents.tsx) anchor link system for Free2Z pages.\n\nActive member of the open-source community. [Contributor to](https://github.com/macintoshhelper?from=2019-12-01&to=2019-12-31&year_list=1):\n\n- [airbnb/react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – render React code to Sketch designs or component library\n- [react-figma](https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – render React code to Figma designs\n- [lona/xd-file](https://github.com/Lona/xd-file/issues/1) – Adobe XD file manipulation utility for Airbnb’s Lona\n- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – one of the most-used React CSS-in-JS libraries\n- [commaai/explorer](https://github.com/commaai/connect/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – annotator for self-driving car video footage\n\n## Technical Approach: How you plan to modify ZECpages UI\n\nI have already written a custom homepage feed and message posting UI for ZECpages: https://github.com/zpublish/platform . This frontend can be reused, it uses virtualised lists/lazy loading for improved performance, supporting page numbers as keys. Remaining tasks would be to:\n\n- Fork the original codebase to ZecHub and I’d be happy to act as a repo maintainer, accepting community contributions\n- Refactor the front-end to use Next.js App Router with `shadcn` and Tailwind\n- Implement the legacy username/password authentication\n- Can implement “Sign in with Zcash” authentication in the future to remove the need for emails/usernames and allow for passwordless authentication\n\n## Hosting & deployment strategy\n\nSelf-hosted first deployment system: to minimise server costs and make it easier for anyone to deploy their own version of ZECpages and be able to pick and choose the architecture that they like (dedicated server, VPS, AWS, etc). An OVH VPS/dedicated server would be used for hosting the app.\n\n- Implement Warp Sync RPC server for a much faster and more stable sync than using the original CLI watcher.\n- Implement Zingo RPC in the future for features like `encryptmessage` which would be required for “Sign in with Zcash” or find an way to incorporate `encryptmessage` into Warp Sync.\n\nThis will be a lightwallet first approach, with the optional of hosting a lightwalletd server with a full node, to minimise hosting costs and make it easier for anyone to deploy their own ZECpages instance.\n\n**Potential features that could be developed in the future would include:**\n\n- Bluesky protocol support\n- `nostr` support (authentication and/or protocol support)\n- Free2Z support\n- OAuth2 provider for API access to allow for third party apps to incorporate ZECpages support\n\n## Estimated Timeline: Breakdown of project phases.\n\n**4 weeks**\n\n*Week 1:*\n\n- Refactor ZPublish Next.js app to use App Router, `shadcn` and Tailwind\n- Mock home page feed API with JSON data archived API data from ZECpages/[JSON mocks](https://github.com/zpublish/platform/blob/master/packages/components/data/zecpages_feed.json)\n\n*Week 2 and 3:*\n\n- Spike using Warp Sync RPC server as a replacement for the `zecwallet` RPC interface.\n- As a fallback, use [`zingo-node`](https://github.com/elemental-zcash/zingo-node) or [Zingo RPC/CLI interface](https://github.com/elemental-pay/wallet-service/blob/main/packages/zec-rpc-gateway/zingolight/api/api.py) as a wallet daemon for listening to new memos and payouts.\n- Refactor the original backend to use Next.js App Router API routes, or if this proves to be a lot of work, re-use the original backend with Knex.js and gradually migrate to using Supabase or Prisma\n\n*Week 4:*\n\n- Work on a moderation backend (delay posts and allow for blacklist intervention, for example via a GitHub PR to a memo ID blacklist JSON file)\n- Deploy the Next.js app and backend to the old or new domain name\n- Pending availability of the old post blacklist or manual review, publish all old ZECpages posts\n- Refactor and deploy the zecpages-likes-payout-script as a cron job/Docker service\n\n## Risks\n\nModeration – if an archive/dump of the old post blacklist isn’t available, then manual human review could be required for restoring all old posts.\n\nFinding the best approach for a wallet listener: the original wallet listener together with a multi-container Docker setup can be used as a safe fallback if an RPC server with Rust bindings proves to be too much work.\n\nIt could be worth delaying the revival of the ZECpages likes payout and work towards implementing multi transaction QR codes pending wallet support, decentralising this process, avoiding temporary custody of funds and resulting in a faster and more stable experience.\n\n## Budget Proposal\n\n\n*Development*\n\n$100 hour rate / 30% discount = $70 / hour\n\n16 hours * 4 weeks = 64 hours\n\n($70 * 64 hours) / $30 = **149.3 ZEC**\n\n*Hosting*\n\nOVH dedicated server\n\n$23 / 12 months = $276\n\n$276.84 / $30 = **9.2 ZEC**\n\n**Total:** 158.5 ZEC\n\n\n$30 used a low point ZEC price over the past months given volatility.",

[Contributor to](https://github.com/macintoshhelper?from=2019-12-01&to=2019-12-31&year_list=1):\n\n- [airbnb/react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – render React code to Sketch designs or component library\n- [react-figma](https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – render React code to Figma designs\n- [lona/xd-file](https://github.com/Lona/xd-file/issues/1) – Adobe XD file manipulation utility for Airbnb’s Lona\n- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – one of the most-used React CSS-in-JS libraries\n- [commaai/explorer](https://github.com/commaai/connect/commits?author=macintoshhelper) – annotator for self-driving car video footage\n\n## Technical Approach\n\nHomepage with searchable merchant list and a physical merchant map to replace the ATM map page.\n\nI have already created a JSON database of all the merchants from `paywithz.cash`: https://github.com/ZecHub/paywithzcash/pull/1/files . This can be easily ported to a mix of markdown/MDX/JSON files to be consumed by [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/).\n\n- Create a Next.js app in the `paywithzcash` repository\n  - I’d be happy to act as a repo maintainer going forward, accepting community contributions\n- Implement [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/) to allow for contributions to markdown/mdx files via GitHub. This eliminates the need for a backend, reducing hosting costs and making contributions more accessible.\n- Use Next.js App Router with `shadcn` and `tailwind-css`\n- Use `react-map-gl` with `maplibre-gl` for interactive merchant map with cluster markers\n\nA backend wrapper over JSON/markdown GitHub PRs can be developed in the future if using GitHub PRs proves to be a barrier to contribution.\n\nExisting merchant upvote counts can be imported; however I feel that restoring the functionality is not enough to justify requiring a full backend. If there is high demand for this functionality, it can be developed in the future, but it would make more sense to focus on working towards developing a process for Zcash ambassadors to represent merchant interest/outreach in specific countries/cities. They can then help keep track of whether merchants continue to accept Zcash.\n\nExample merchant schema:\n\n`merchants/favorites/Flexa.md`\n\n```md\n---\nname: Flexa\nurl: https://spedn.io/\nsubtitle: Spend Zcash in person at Dunkin, Ulta Beauty, GameStop, Topgolf, Express, Petco, Office Depot, Nordstrom, Caribou Coffee, Bed Bath & Beyond, and AMC Theatres.\ntags: \"Dunkin\", \"Dunkin Donuts\", \"Baskin Robbins\", \"Caribou\", \"Caribou coffee\", \"coffee\"\nlogo: ./logos/flexa.jpg\n---\n```\n\n`merchants/physical/cafe/RedRockCoffeehouse.md`\n\n```md\n---\nname: Red Rock Coffeehouse\nsubtitle: Locally owned coffeeshop in Boulder Colorado\ntags: \"coffee\", \"colorado\", \"boulder\", \"chai\", \"cafe\", \"local\"\nlogo: ./logos/red-rock-coffehouse.jpg\npluscode: 2PPQ+8Q Boulder, Colorado, USA\naddress: 3325 28th St, Boulder, CO 80301, United States\ncoordinates: 40.03582541231773, -105.26053114146632\ncountry: US\n---\n```\n\n## Hosting & deployment strategy\n\nThe website can initially be a static HTML export generated with Next.js *static exports* to minimise hosting costs and allow for hosting on a CDN. The infrastructure will be self-hosting friendly if anyone would like to host a copy locally or on their own hardware/infrastructure.\n\nThe website would be hosted on CloudFlare Pages or GitHub Pages with CloudFlare used as a CDN. GitHub Actions would trigger new builds/deployments when changes/contributions are merged to `main`.\n\n## Estimated Timeline: Breakdown of project phases\n\n**4 weeks**\n\n*Weeks 1 and 2:*\n\n- Develop the initial Next.js app with a redesign, using `shadcn` and `tailwind-css`\n- Migrate the merchant JSON data to markdown files\n  - This could be automated with a Node.js script\n- Deploy the Next.js app to the existing or new domain name\n\n*Weeks 3 and 4:*\n\n- Create the physical merchant map using `react-map-gl` and `maplibre-gl`\n  - Virtualised clusters to improve performance\n  - Add ATMs that support Zcash\n  - Filtering by country/city\n- Create contribution documentation and a process for adding, removing or updating existing merchants via GitHub. There should be a tag for the last date that someone verified that a merchant still accepts Zcash.\n\n**Possible Future Improvements**\n\n- Bounties for onboarding new merchants\n  - This can be split between the person onboarding the merchant, and the merchant itself\n  - Users could create RFPs/sponsor bounties for merchants that they frequent\n  - Possible revenue source to fund future development for `paywithz.cash`\n  - Bounties could also fund merchant discounts for paying with Zcash (e.g. a fund for 15% off for Zcash payments)\n- Sponsored merchants\n  - Another possible revenue source to fund future development\n- Onboarding Zcash ambassadors for specific countries or cities\n  - This will make maintaining the merchant list easier and allow for improved merchant outreach\n\n\n## Budget Proposal\n\n\n**Development**\n\n$100 hour rate / 30% discount = $70 / hour\n\n5 hours * 4 weeks = 20 hours\n\n$70 * 20 hours = $1400\n\n$1400 / $30 (ZECUSD) = 46.6 ZEC\n\n**Hosting**\n\nFree or negligible costs for static site hosting.\n\n**Total:** 46.6 ZEC\n",

      "description": "## Background ##\nLocal Zcash is an initiative that started last year  REFERENCE (https://free2z.cash/Mr_Moosty/zpage/local-zcash-movement ) with the aim of replicating the \"Solana All Star\" model, a grassroots approach that has made Solana the dominant and most used cryptocurrency in the African region, particularly in Nigeria. This model focuses on targeting grassroots communities across the country through content localization and breaking language barriers via local meetups in rural areas, reaching people who need decentralized finance the most.\n\nDue to limited community support and resource constraints, many of our initial goals could not be achieved last year. However, in 2025, we have reignited the movement with renewed energy to onboard as many users as possible to the Zcash ecosystem.\nWhile Nigeria is already a key catchment area for Zcash adoption, we believe much more can be achieved. \nThere is no better way to connect and onboard people than through in-person meetups. We recognize the existing Zcash Nigeria community is doing excellent work, and our aim is to complement their efforts by focusing specifically on organizing high-impact local events and meetups. \n\n## Our Progress So Far ##\n\n### Localized contents on X: ###\nhttps://x.com/Local_Zcash/status/1884277484159684926    \nhttps://x.com/Local_Zcash/status/1885972940023316796    \nhttps://x.com/Local_Zcash/status/1886025957716218307 \n\n### Announced and onboarded Volunteers: ###\nhttps://x.com/Local_Zcash/status/1885030098505466172    \nhttps://x.com/Local_Zcash/status/1886822053950443574\n\n### Sponsored Volunteers to Solana All star event in Zamfara: ###\nhttps://x.com/Local_Zcash/status/1893202246105477382\n\nThese are just a few of some of the things we have achieved so far. \n\n## Current Proposal: Zcash Meetup in Lokoja, Nigeria (North Central) ##\nLokoja, Nigeria has demonstrated significant cryptocurrency adoption rates in Nigeria, making it an ideal location for expanding Zcash awareness and usage. The city's tech-savvy population and growing interest in financial privacy solutions position it as a strategic hub for Zcash community building.\n\n### Event Details ###\n\nVenue:  TBA\n\nDate : TBA \n\n### Financial Requirements ###\n1. Venue rental: Secure space at a tech hub with good equipment like projectors, screens, Speakers e.t.c. \n2. Promotional materials: Flyers and banners\n3. Zcash-branded merchandise: T-shirts, stickers, etc.\n4. Zcash-branded notepads: For attendee notes and future reference\n5. Professional photography: Document the event\n6. Refreshments For all attendees\n7. Extra ZEC: For onboarding activities and demonstrations\n\nTotal ZEC Requested: 45 $ZEC \n\n## Expected Outcomes ##\nThe Lokoja meetup will deliver several key benefits for the Zcash ecosystem with upto 80 - 100 Attendees including Experienced Speakers.\n\nFinancial Privacy Education: Introduce attendees to the importance of financial privacy in the digital age and how Zcash provides this solution\n\n\nPractical Onboarding: Guide attendees through downloading Zcash wallets and conducting their first transactions\n\n\nCommunity Growth:\nGet attendees to subscribe to Zcash shielded newsletters, Facilitate joining Zcash community platforms and Create local support networks for new users. \n\nEcosystem Participation: Educate participants about Zcash bounties and other opportunities to contribute to the ecosystem\n\n\nMeasurable Impact: We will track metrics including number of new wallets created, community memberships, and follow-up engagement\n\n## Next Steps ##\nUpon approval of this proposal, we will:\n1. Finalize the event date and secure the venue\n2. Begin promotional activities in Lokoja\n3. Prepare educational materials tailored to the local context\n4. Coordinate with the broader Zcash Nigeria community\n\n\nBelow is an example of some of the slides I'll be using to present during the event: \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/18HNq7NHZAnPYFSQRdqmV_WXTHCGHaMnL/view?usp=drivesdk \n\nNote: The purpose of the slide is to make things easier for attendees. Key explanations will be expanded upon, and the slide may be improved after this proposal based on community feedback.\n\nThen a proper plan / schedule of event is contained in the docs below:  \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwvEGsABw_ATcysfyrheGa7nqdT2JRzK02qTO5NlUQU/edit?usp=sharing  \n\nWe welcome feedback on this proposal and look forward to contributing to Zcash adoption in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "### **Background**\nEurope’s crypto market is expanding rapidly, with millions actively using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Despite this growth, awareness of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Zcash—offering enhanced security and anonymity—remains limited. With millions of students across European universities, this project aims to position Zcash as a leader in privacy-centric blockchain technology. The initiative will emphasize Zcash’s ability to provide confidential, shielded transactions, a feature increasingly vital in a privacy-conscious digital world.\n\n### **Why**\nThis project seeks to raise awareness of Zcash across European university campuses, targeting students and young professionals interested in privacy, digital currencies, and blockchain technology. Zcash’s shielded transactions make it ideal for those prioritizing confidentiality in digital payments. Through this initiative, we aim to onboard hundreds of students to the Zcash network, equipping them with practical skills—such as sending shielded payments—via wallets, privacy features, and real-world applications. Workshops and events will enable students to learn about and engage with Zcash meaningfully, driving mainstream adoption of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.\n\n### **Proposal**\nThis proposal outlines a plan to bring Zcash education to European universities, starting with a pilot in Athens through the Erasmus Greece Student Network (10,000+ students across Greece). Launching with recreational team activities like football—chosen for its cultural appeal in Athens—we will foster collaboration and connections. The initiative will scale to other European universities over time. Educational events will highlight privacy’s importance in the digital age and introduce Zcash’s ecosystem through hands-on workshops, discussions, and practical use cases. Unlike traditional workshops, recurring interactive events will ensure sustained engagement, build local communities, and create a pipeline of developers for the Zcash ecosystem.\n\n### **Student Engagement**\nErasmus students are known for engaging in extracurricular activities, making this program a natural fit for their experience. By blending social activities with technical workshops, we will ensure students gain skills while strengthening community ties and collaborating on real-world projects, such as building a Zcash payment tool.\n\n### **Expansion Strategy**\nBeyond the Erasmus pilot, we will partner with universities and bootcamps to reach more students. Starting in additional Greek cities, we will expand across Europe, creating a student network that adopts Zcash for peer-to-peer transactions.\n\n### **Project Structure & Format**\n**Program Duration**: 2 Months  \n**Bi-weekly Workshops**:  \n#### **Pilot & Weekly Agenda**  \n- **Recreational Activities (1 hour)**:  \n  Casual events like football in Athens (free vs. typical €25 local event cost) to foster collaboration, with future iterations offering varied team activities for broader appeal.  \n- **Introductory Workshops (1 hour)**:  \n  - Overview of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and Zcash’s privacy features  \n  - Hands-on setup of Zcash wallets and shielded transactions  \n  - Using Zcash for everyday purchases and comparing it to Bitcoin  \n\n#### **Engagement Activities**\nInformal events to encourage networking among students passionate about privacy, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.\n\n#### **Survey and Feedback**\nPost-workshop surveys to assess students’ understanding of Zcash, its privacy features, and interest in future use.\n\n### **Funding Request**\n**Requested Amount**: 70 ZEC (total for 2 months)  \n**Budget Breakdown**:  \n- One-time banner creation: 4 ZEC  \n- Venue rent (4 events): 40 ZEC  \n- Organization and management: 20 ZEC  \n- Refreshments: 6 ZEC  \n\n### **Team and Allocation**\n- **Project Manager – Alreqeb**  \n  *Experience*: Over 7 years in digital media and business development, skilled in building partnerships/ scaling communities and Zcash community member.  \n  *Responsibility*: Project oversight, workshop organization, university liaison, and event execution.  \n  *Link*: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammed-alreqeb-8a4358131/)  \n\n- **Event Planner – Mary**  \n  *Experience*: Over 4 years as Local Event Coordinator for ESN Athens Hub.  \n  *Responsibility*: Event logistics, attendance tracking, student outreach, and managing local partnerships.  \n  *References*: [ESN Athens](https://www.instagram.com/esnathens.aueb/), [Coordinator ](https://www.instagram.com/esninathens/)  \n\n### **Objectives & Impact**\n- **Onboarding Students**: Educate 100+ students in the Athens pilot (with plans to scale across Europe) about Zcash’s benefits, privacy features, and applications.  \n- **Privacy Awareness**: Highlight privacy’s role in the digital economy, focusing on payments and data security.  \n- **Engagement**: Foster long-term engagement, targeting 50% of participants to continue using Zcash post-project.  \n- **Feedback**: Collect insights on shielded transactions and wallet usability.\n\n### **Milestones**\n**Month 1**:  \n- Outreach to 100+ students  \n- Conduct introductory workshops on Zcash and privacy  \n- Survey students on digital privacy and blockchain understanding  \n**Month 2**:  \n- Assist students in setting up Zcash wallets  \n- Facilitate testing of shielded transactions  \n- Ensure 20+ early adopters actively use Zcash wallets  \n- Gather feedback on usability and adoption interest  \n- Launch a community forum with 50+ members  \n\n### **Post-Project Survey & Community Building**\n- Survey participants on their Zcash experience  \n- Launch a Telegram-based community forum for ongoing privacy and Zcash discussions  \n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis project will empower students to adopt Zcash and advance its mission of financial privacy. Through workshops, hands-on learning, and community engagement, we will create an environment where students understand and use Zcash in daily transactions, driving the next generation of privacy-conscious users worldwide.\n\n---\n Vote Yes to approve the Zcash Privacy Empowerment on Campus initiative!\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hello ZecHub community,\n\nMy name is Beyond, and I’m an active contributor to the privacy-focused Web3 ecosystem through my involvement with projects like Nym and Web3Privacy Now. I’m based in Ukraine, and I’d like to propose the launch of a Zcash Ukraine Regional Community Initiative to increase awareness, education, and practical usage of Zcash in Ukraine — a region where privacy-preserving technologies are becoming increasingly vital.\n\nProject Summary\n\nThe Zcash Ukraine initiative aims to foster an active local community of Zcash users and advocates in Ukraine. Through educational content, social media outreach, and offline events, the initiative will spread awareness of the value of private digital payments and how Zcash helps protect financial autonomy in a time of growing government surveillance and financial censorship.\n\nWhy Ukraine?\n\nUkraine is currently at the crossroads of war, humanitarian crisis, digital transformation, and increasing financial scrutiny.

      "description": "OVERVIEW\nThe Zcash Ghana Initiative is a grassroots, multi-stakeholder movement aimed at creating a self-sustaining ecosystem for the adoption and use of Zcash, a leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency in Ghana. Through local education, business onboarding, developer outreach, and content localization, this initiative seeks to empower Ghanaians with tools to transact freely, securely, and privately.\nWe are committed to building a Ghanaian Zcash ecosystem from the ground up starting with a regional community hub, merchant integrations, and consistent educational programming in English, Twi, and other relevant local languages.\nWhy Zcash Privacy Adoption Is Urgently Needed in Ghana\n1. Increasing Financial Surveillance\nWhile Ghana is considered one of Africa's more open democracies, there is a growing digital footprint tied to mobile money, bank accounts, and tax systems. With rising integration between banking systems and identity databases, Ghanaians are increasingly subject to unconsented financial tracking.\nAs the government pushes digital taxation, social security registration, and mobile identity verification, Zcash offers a critical tool to preserve financial privacy and protect users from overreach or future abuse.\n2. High Mobile Money Penetration Without Privacy\nGhana is among the top countries in Africa in mobile money usage, with over 40% of adults transacting via MTN Mobile Money, Vodafone Cash, or AirtelTigo. However, these platforms do not offer privacy because every payment is logged, analyzed, and often shared with third parties.\nZcash can complement mobile money by offering private peer-to-peer alternatives that are:\nFee-less or low-fee\nFast and censorship-resistant\nAvailable without needing a bank or telco approval\n\n\n3. Cash Depreciation and Inflation Pressure\nAlthough relatively stable compared to some neighbors, the Ghanaian cedi has seen frequent depreciation, eroding citizens’ purchasing power. Zcash provides a borderless store of value and hedge, especially for freelancers, remote workers, and youth receiving crypto payments.\n4. SMEs and Informal Sector Need Private Digital Tools\nGhana's economy is powered by millions of informal small businesses that conduct daily transactions. These merchants:\nOften dealt with security risks when handling physical cash\nHave no access to private digital alternatives\nNeed faster, cheaper, privacy-enhanced methods for handling transactions and accepting payments across borders\nIntegrating Zcash into their operations offers instant, private, secure digital payment infrastructure especially important for cross-border trade, wholesalers, and tech-savvy retail entrepreneurs.\n5. Digital Youth Culture and Rising Tech Literacy\nOver 57% of Ghana's population is under 25, and this youth segment is already exploring crypto through platforms like Binance, Yellow Card, and Paxful. Many are eager for:\nFinancial independence\nFreelance income from abroad\nDigital investment tools\nZcash appeals to this demographic because it’s privacy-first, open-source, and gives real control over their money.\n\n\nProject Objectives\nEducate Ghanaians about Zcash and the importance of financial privacy\nBuild a Zcash community in Ghana, with active Telegram and X (Twitter) presence, AMAs, and monthly webinars\nOnboard real businesses and merchants in Accra, Kumasi, Tamale, Takoradi, and Cape Coast to accept Zcash\nEngage exchanges and wallet providers to improve access and support for shielded transactions in Ghana\nCollaborate with local developers and groups to build and experiment with privacy-preserving tools using Zcash\nLocalize Zcash knowledge through articles, videos, and live sessions in English and local languages\nLaunch ZcashGhana social media pages - a content and learning hub with tutorials, merchant listings, and translations\n\n\nScope of the Project\n1. Business Integration: Bringing Zcash into Ghanaian Commerce\nIdentify and partner with 10+ small businesses (cafés, retail stores, eateries /food vendors, hotels, creative vendors, beauty salons, local logistics) to accept ZEC payments\nEducate businesses on effectively using Zcash wallets with options of transparent and shielded transactions, understanding ZEC (Zcash cryptocurrency), and navigating centralized exchanges for seamless transactions and cashing out when needed.\nAssist businesses in downloading and installing Zcash wallets on their mobile phones, desktops, or laptops, ensuring proper setup and security for smooth daily transactions.\nAssist businesses in generating and printing Zcash wallet QR codes to enable quick, scan-based customer payments, along with providing basic Point of Sale (POS) support for seamless transaction tracking.\nProvide Zcash-focused training and educating materials to educate business owners and staff, along with offering customer incentives in ZEC to encourage adoption and promote usage. \nEducate and onboard local businesses using Ghana local language.\nCreate video testimonials and case studies of merchants using Zcash and adopting the Zcash wallet.\nCreate and maintain a “Zcash Accepted Here” directory on ZcashGhana page to showcase local businesses that accept ZEC, helping customers easily find where they can spend their Zcash and encouraging wider adoption within the community\n\n\n2. Strategic Partnerships\nPartner with:\n\n\nCrypto-friendly cafés, co-working spaces and Universities.\nCommunities in Ghana and neighboring regions focused on Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and broader Web3 ecosystems—including decentralized applications (dApps), DAOs, NFTs, and DeFi platforms.\n\n\nTech hubs like MEST Africa, Kumasi Hive, iSpace\n\n\nLocal YouTubers, Tech innovators, Web3 educators, and Influencers.\n\n\nCollaborate with regional Crypto and Web3 events to host Zcash Ghana booths or workshops, promoting ZEC adoption through hands-on education, wallet onboarding, live demonstrations, and community engagement.\n3. Community Growth & Events\nMonthly Meetups: Physical meetings, Hackathons and Zcash used cases project development as well as demonstration.\nTelegram, Youtube, Twitter and Tiktok and Instagram Community (moderated in English & Twi)\n\n\nMonthly Webinars: Featuring developers, merchants, or privacy advocates\nAMA Sessions with Zcash Foundation members or community contributors\nMonthly Contests: Memes, quizzes, or photo-based contests rewarding participants in ZEC\n\n\n\n\n4. ZcashGhana Social media page  – Community and Education Hub  \nCentral website for:\n\n\nArticles, tutorials, FAQs (in English and Twi)\nTranslated announcements from the Zcash ecosystem\nBusiness onboarding kits\nEvent calendar and webinar registration\nLocal merchant map\n\n\n5.

In addition, they have been active since 2022 and are part of the Zk Av Club.\n\nMany of you know him: Robmar. He is a multimedia professional, a member of the Zcash core team in Spanish, and has collaborated closely with recent events such as the ECC Summit, the latest Zcon, and other online activities of the global community. He is also the creator of ZK Radio, Zcash's online radio station, where any of us can have a program in any language.\n\nRobmar has shown his interest in contributing and collaborating more with ZecHub, so I think this is a perfect opportunity for him to join the DAO and participate in decisions and discussions.\n\nSo, my proposal is: Do you agree to add Robmar as a new member of the DAO?\n\nHis Twitter: https://x.com/robmarn\nZk Radio: https://zcashesp.com/zk-radio/\n\nIf you have any questions about him, you can ask me on Telegram or Discord.\n\nThank you all for your attention.",

Read Namada x Zcash Alliance: https://vknowable.github.io/knowable-blog/namada-zcash-alliance/\n\nIn preparation for the Namada Shielded Airdrop to Zcash holders, community building between ecosystems will be mutually beneficial. \n\nTowards our goal of becoming a Shielded Ecosystem platform we have launched a Penumbra Bounty Program and propose extending this to support Namada as well.  \n\n\n## Why?\n\nBounty programs are an established way to incentivize community building & collaboration while promoting open-source contributions from across the world. This means:\n\n- Extending Zechub’s educational and contributor base into Namada’s ecosystem.  \n- Rewarding contributors directly in NAM/ZEC or other shielded assets to reinforce privacy-first usage.  \n- Encouraging collaboration between Zcash and Namada communities.  \n- Increasing visibility of Zechub as an education platform across ecosystems.  \n\n## Proposal\n\nZecHub will establish a **Namada Bounty Program** to reward contributors with NAM tokens (Possibly ZEC / Other Shielded Assets). Bounties will include:  \n- Writing guides, documentation, or tutorials about Namada.  \n- Building out our Namada Wiki & dashboards. https://namada.zechub.wiki\n- Increased Community outreach, event participation, or onboarding initiatives.  \n\n\n## Action\n\nBy voting \"Yes\" you approve for:  \n- ZecHub DAO to allocate a starting budget 25,000 NAM tokens for bounty distribution.  \n- The dework Namada bounty board will be used to list community tasks.  https://dework.zechub.org\n- DAO to review results on a monthly basis and adjust accordingly.",

      "description": "# Background\nIn our earlier proposal for a Zcash grant-tracking and progress platform ([link] https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-grant-punchlist-proposal/49254), budget concerns were raised. Since then, we’ve worked on similar systems across other networks and DAOs, streamlined the approach, and can now provide the solution for  **$3,500.**\n\nZerodart has already experimented with an alpha version of a grant-tracking dashboard. This initiative builds on that groundwork by delivering a production-ready version with automated milestone tracking, alerts, and backend support to ensure long-term reliability.”\n\n# Summary\nBuild a dashboard to visualize Zcash community grants, allowing members to track progress transparently. The dashboard will be integrated into the Zcash Community Grants site, providing clear views of milestones, visual progress indicators, and alert mechanisms.\n\n# Problem Statement\nCurrently, tracking Zcash grant progress can be challenging, with updates scattered across forum threads and limited transparency into milestone completion or delays. This lack of clarity can make it difficult for the community to assess progress, identify issues early, and understand potential deviations from grant scopes.\n\n# Proposed Solution\nDevelop a **Grant Milestone Dashboard** that will:  \n- **Track Individual Grants:** Each grant will have a detailed milestone list, with progress bars or percentage indicators for clarity.  \n- **Provide Alerts:** Automatic alerts will flag delays or deviations from the approved scope.  \n- **Offer Unified Access:** A single, user-friendly location for monitoring all active grants.  \n\n# Budget Breakdown & Milestones\n\n### Milestone 1: Design, Feedback & Frontend Development (2 weeks)  \n**Cost: $1,000**  \n\n**Activities:**  \n- **Dashboard Design & Wireframes**  \n  - Grant Overview Page: Displays a summary of all active grants with status indicators (e.g., % complete, “On Track,” or “Delayed”).  \n  - Individual Grant Pages: Detailed view of each grant’s milestones, completion percentages, and timelines.  \n\n- **Frontend Development**  \n  - Build a responsive framework for desktop and mobile accessibility.  \n  - Milestone Tracking: Grant milestones with status, completion bars, and estimated completion dates.  \n  - Progress Indicators: Visual bars or percentage markers to show progress at both overall grant and individual milestone levels.  \n\n---\n\n### Milestone 2: Backend Development & Finalization (2 weeks)  \n**Cost: $2,500**  \n\n**Activities:**  \n- Build a milestone tracking and data aggregation engine (GitHub, Forum, and Discord) with project views and live updates.  \n- Add filterable dashboards, risk visualizations, treasury dashboard, and admin controls.  \n\n**Alert System:**  \n- Automatically flags and sends alerts for overdue milestones or deviations from the original scope.  \n- Notifications can be sent to community members or displayed directly on the dashboard.  \n\n---\n\n**Total: $3,500 – 4 weeks development**\n\n# Benefits to the Zcash Community\n- **Transparency:** Enables real-time tracking of grant progress.  \n- **Accountability:** Provides a visual progress overview to keep grant recipients aligned with their milestones.  \n- **Engagement:** The dashboard’s unified design improves accessibility and ease of monitoring.  \n- **Risk Management:** Enables earlier detection of delivery issues and proactive actions to prevent delays.  \n\n# Additional Background\n**BuildUnion** is a collective of developers, designers, and strategists focused on Web3 tooling, DAO infrastructure, and decentralized governance. We operate as an integrated unit to deliver high-impact, production-grade applications.  \n\nPersonally, I bring extensive multi-chain experience as a **Web3 Architect** and long-time contributor to decentralized governance. I was an early contributor to Dash, helping shape some of the first DAO governance mechanisms, and have since contributed to:  \n- Polkadot’s governance infrastructure  \n- Solana’s developer tooling  \n- Arweave’s storage protocols  \n- Arbitrum DAO community initiatives  \n\nMy expertise includes front-end and back-end development, data integration, and the design of transparent tracking systems.  \n\nA recent relevant example is my work on **OG Tracker for the Polkadot ecosystem**, a tool to monitor project and governance activity. This cross-chain perspective enables me to design interoperable, user-focused solutions directly applicable to the Zcash ecosystem.  \n\n- **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/emmanueleclipsewebsite/](http://linkedin.com/in/emmanueleclipsewebsite/)  \n\n---\n\n# Visual Reference\nSample image: [https://ibb.co/PsjxrbNx](https://ibb.co/PsjxrbNx)  \n*The dashboard for the Zcash community will be customized with branding and a color scheme to match.*  \n\n---\n\n**Best regards,**  \n*Emmanuel / BuildUnion*  \n\n\n",

      "description": "Project Description:\nThe Zcash Ghana driving focus is to continue onboarding Ghanaians crypto users and businesses to the Zcash blockchain through its mission of blockchain education and financial privacy. This project started officially on June 30th 2025 with the creation of its X (twitter) handle @ZcashGH, where contents promoting Zcash and financial privacy were posted. Also we have been able to host X-Space events and physical meetup where we educated over 25 persons about Zcash and onboard them to Zcash through the creation of their Zcash wallets. Currently we have over 20 Ghanaians signed up as Zcash Ghana Volunteers.\n\nThe Goal is to continue building an active Zcash Ghana community across various cities in Ghana. Educate Ghanains about Zcash’s privacy features and real-world applications. Increase the accessibility of Zcash-related content through localization and translation. Enhance user engagement through interactive activities, contests, and webinars. Encourage discussions on blockchain privacy and financial security within Ghana and ensuring wider adoption and understanding of privacy-focused blockchain technology in Ghana and Africa at large. Foster collaborations between Zcash and regional blockchain developers to create new privacy-focused solutions.\n\nThe reason for this grant:\nWe are asking for this grant to help us continue building the Zcash Ghana community through our various blockchain education and financial privacy activities which include content creations, educational gaming, meetups and workshops, as well as collaborate with other web3 communities, all these leading towards more adoption of Zcash protocol in Ghana. With this grant we will host monthly Zcash Ghana physical meetup, monthly X-Space event and monthly game challenge together with educational content posts.\n\nPast work:\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ghana-meetup-1-onboarding-to-zcash/51917\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/join-the-zcash-ghana-x-space-event-02-why-zcash-exploring-shielded-payments-business-potential/51648\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/join-the-maiden-zcash-ghana-x-space-event-this-sunday/51597\n\nRequested amount for 3 months: 4500 USD (1500 USD per month)\n\nConclusion: \nZcash Ghana will serve as a vital hub for Ghanaians to learn, engage, and participate in the Zcash ecosystem. By combining content creation, community management, and strategic outreach, towards executing our mission of blockchain education and financial privacy for the activation of an active community dedicated to Zcash and its mission. \n\nThank you.",

      "description": "Background\n\nSince February 2025, I have been serving as the Korean Global Ambassador for Zcash.\n\nOver the past six months, I have focused on building visibility, accessibility, and community engagement for Zcash among Korean users. Thanks to the support of ZecHub DAO, I was able to grow the Korean community and create the foundation for further expansion.\n\nZcash Korea X (Twitter): Grew from 12 followers (Feb 13, 2025) to 310 followers (Sep 13, 2025). Posts now average 15–20 likes per post.\n\nCommunity Channels: Established and currently managing KakaoTalk and Telegram communities.\n\nEducational Content: Published blog posts and guides in Korean (e.g., Brave Wallet, Zashi usage, Organization related to Zcash ).\n\nCommunity Events: Hosted campaigns to encourage shielded address usage among Korean users.\n\n\nProblem Statement\n\nKorean users remain underrepresented in the global Zcash community, despite Korea being one of the most active markets for blockchain adoption in Asia. Without consistent Korean-language content, education, and community engagement, Zcash risks losing visibility in this important region.\n\n\nObjectives\n\nMy key goals are:\n\nEstablish the largest Zcash community in Asia (by growing the Korean base).\n\nRecruit at least 2 Korean ZecHub DAO members by the end of 2025.\n\nBuild sustainable engagement channels for Korean users.\n\n\nProposed Activities\n\nContent & Translation: Provide timely Korean translations of Zcash updates, reports, and announcements.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Grow activity on X, KakaoTalk, and Telegram through daily/weekly content and discussions.\n\nEvents: Host at least one community event per month (giveaways, shielded address campaigns, AMAs, etc.).\n\nReporting: Publish a monthly Zcash Korea report to share updates with the DAO.\n\nBrand Presence: Maintain the X verification badge to ensure trust and credibility.\n\n\nDeliverables\n\nMonthly Zcash updates (Korean translations)\n\n4 community events (1 per month)\n\n4 monthly Zcash Korea reports\n\nRecruitment of at least 2 Korean ZecHub DAO members\n\nSteady growth of X followers and community activity\n\n\nBudget\n\nMonthly Compensation: $500\n\nTotal (4 months): $2,000\n\n\nClosing\n\nIf this proposal is approved, I will continue my work not for personal financial gain, but with the mission of helping Zcash establish a strong and sustainable presence in Korea. With the DAO’s support, I believe we can build the largest and most vibrant Zcash community in Asia.\n\nThank you for your continued support.",

      "description": "## Greetings, Zcashers!\n \nWithout a doubt, Zcash has had a tremendous year. Beyond the price of ZEC (which is important, but not the most important thing), over the last 11 months we have had a halving, major wallet updates, updates to Zebra, a powerful new Zcon, and a host of partnerships with other projects, such as Brave, Nym, Namada, Flexa, Near, Keystone, etc.\n\n \nAnd all this because, thanks to internal leadership from the ECC and the ZF, the narrative about what momentum, marketing, and the Zcash brand mean has changed. This is how, in recent months, we have seen Zcash's presence at major events in Asia, Europe, and the United States, thanks to the participation of Josh (ECC), Zooko, and members of the ZCG, among others.\n\n \nThe communities are also making a great effort: events in Nigeria, Ghana, Turkey, Brazil, and the Spanish-speaking Zcash community promoting Zcash's presence in Mexico and Spain, as well as Venezuela, thanks to the Zcash Clubs.\n\n \nAnd that is bearing fruit.\n\n \nThis year, Aura Brito and I (team Zcast) have once again been invited to participate in this major event, the European Blockchain Convention 2025, in addition to BNEW. The cost of tickets to these events is over €1,500, and they have been given to us for free.\n\n \nLast year we were invited to four events in three cities: the European Blockchain Convention and BNEW in Barcelona, Madrid Tech Show in Madrid, and HCPP in Prague.\n\n \n**This year we are going for more!**\n\n \nAura and I now live in Barcelona, and with the networking we have been building over the last few months, the stage is set for us to attend more events on behalf of Zcash, do more networking, create more multimedia content, talk to more people about Zcash, and strategically continue to spread the message of privacy.\n\n \n**For this fall-winter season, we have put together a schedule of key events in Spain to increase our positioning and visibility. These events are:**\n\n\nWatch Out Bitcoin: https://wobitcoin.org/\n\nMerge Madrid: https://www.mmerge.io/es\n\nMadrid Tech Show: https://www.techshowmadrid.es/\n\n**To cover tickets, transportation and accommodation costs in Madrid, the total amount is €4,000 (approximately $4,700 USD).**\n\n \n## Why are these events important?\n \n**BNEW,** is the largest technology and entrepreneurship event in Barcelona. It is a media event and we already have tickets, because we were invited.\n\n\n**EBC (European Blockchain Convention),** although not a privacy-focused event, is one of the most important conferences on blockchain in Europe. It brings together the main blockchain projects and their communities. Even Monero enthusiasts attend. We have already been invited and have tickets.\n\n\n\n**Madrid Tech Show,** like last year, we have been invited and already have tickets. Although it is not a blockchain technology event, it is an e-commerce event for people and startups interested in new forms of payment. We believe it is important to raise awareness of Zcash as a payment alternative.\n\n\n\n**Watchout Bitcoin,** an event about Bitcoin, where Zcash should have a presence. More and more bitcoiners are looking for alternatives for their privacy. In my opinion, Zcash should always have a presence at every Bitcoin event, because Zcash is a private Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n**Merge Madrid,** a 100% crypto and web3 event. A space where Zcash must make itself visible in Spain and throughout Europe. Speakers and communities from the main crypto projects in the ecosystem gather here.\n\n\n \n \n**As I mentioned above, the idea of attending these events is to establish a presence as the Zcash brand, to make ourselves visible, and to establish new contacts and approaches with projects, professionals, or organizations that may be interested in Zcash.**\n\n\n \nZcash continues on its path toward an unstoppable transformation from within, with its governance, improving its protocol, and offering the best wallets and technology in the blockchain ecosystem. And our commitment is to make that visible to as many people as possible.\n\n \n \n## Who we are.\n\n \n**Roosevelt Gordones,** moderator of Zcash en Español, co-host of Zcast, co-host of Club Zcash Barcelona, member of the core team of Zcash en Español, as well as the core team of the Zk Av Club.\n\n \n**Aura Brito,** Co-host of Zcast, co-host of Club Zcash Barcelona, member of the core team of Zcash en Español, part of the marketing team at Zingo Labs en Español, and also a member of the Zk Av Club.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n \nCovering events involves a lot of work: making videos, conducting interviews, contacting people, and creating content for social media, which not only leaves a record of our presence but also showcases what we have achieved.\n\n \n**The deliverables for the events are described below:**\n\n \n**EBC (European Blockchain Convention) Oct. 16-17**\n\n- 2 live summaries of the day (one for each day of the event) (YouTube)\n- 2 videos interviewing and talking with some of the event attendees (YouTube)\n- Live tweets during the conferences and event activities (X)\n\n \n**Watch Out Bitcoin Oct. 3, 4, and 5**\n- 3 live summaries of the day (YouTube)\n- 3 videos interviewing and talking with some of the event attendees\n- Live tweets during the conferences and event activities (X)\n\n \n**Merge Madrid Oct. 7, 8, and 9**\n- 3 live videos summarizing the day (YouTube)\n- 3 videos interviewing and chatting with some of the event attendees\n- Live tweets during the conferences and event activities (X)\n\n \n**Madrid Tech Show Oct. 29-30**\n- 2 live videos summarizing the day (one for each day of the event) (YouTube)\n- 2 videos interviewing and chatting with some of the event attendees (YouTube)\n- Live tweets during the conferences and event activities (X)\n\n \n**Total event coverage content:**\n- 10 live streams (YouTube)\n- 10 videos interviewing and chatting (YouTube)\n- +100 live tweets (X)\n \nAs a member of the Zk Av Club, to which we also belong, this work is a kind of mobile recording station, because although we will not have our own stand or kiosk at the events, we will be walking around with cameras and microphones in hand, approaching people, asking for their impressions and, obviously, telling them about what we do at Zcash globally and in Spain with the Zcash Barcelona Club.\n\n \nThe purpose of all this is for Zcash to have an increasing presence in Spain's vibrant and active technology and blockchain community, and for people to start getting used to seeing Zcash and hearing the privacy narrative that we always promote.\n\n\n## In summary: Do you approve of providing funds to cover these events?\n\n**Vote YES if you agree.**\n\n**Vote NO if you disagree.**\n\nWe count on your support to cover this route of events and bring Zcash to more people.\n \n### Let's keep promoting freedom and privacy!",

      "description": "# Zcash Ukraine Regional Community Initiative  \n**Period:** December 2025 – May 2026  \n**Submitted by:** Beyond  \n\n---\n\n## Introduction  \nDear Zcash Community,  \n\nMy name is Beyond, and I coordinate the Zcash Ukraine Regional Community Initiative. Since June 2025, we have been actively building a Ukrainian-speaking community focused on education, awareness, and practical adoption of private digital payments using Zcash.  \n\nThanks to community support and prior grants, we have achieved high activity levels with around **100 posts per month** across multiple platforms, successful offline events, and an engaged regional ambassador who has already contributed significantly to event organization. We now seek continued funding to further develop the initiative from December 2025 through May 2026.  \n\n## Why Ukraine?  \nUkraine remains in a complex situation of war, economic instability, and increasing financial surveillance. At the same time, more people are adopting cryptocurrencies as a safeguard for their assets and freedom.  \n\nZcash, as a protocol with strong privacy protections, is uniquely positioned to empower freelancers, activists, entrepreneurs, and everyday citizens by providing secure tools for financial autonomy that are resistant to censorship and surveillance.  \n\n## Project Goals (December 2025 – May 2026)  \n- Continue growing and scaling the Ukrainian-language Zcash community.  \n- Create and distribute high-quality localized educational content in Ukrainian.  \n- Onboard new users with a focus on practical usage of ZEC wallets.  \n- Host two offline meetups to deepen community engagement and facilitate onboarding.  \n- Support and expand the network of regional ambassadors to sustain growth.  \n\n## Work Plan  \n### Content and Communication (Monthly):  \n- Manage active presence on Telegram, Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn.  \n- Produce approximately **100 posts monthly**, including educational materials, news, threads, infographics, and video explainers.   \n\n### Offline Activities:  \n- Organize **two offline meetups** during the proposal period in Dnipro or other cities.  \n- Event formats include workshops, hands-on sessions, and practical Zcash wallet onboarding.  \n\n### Ambassador Support:  \n- Maintain engagement of at least one regional ambassador who has already supported past events, with potential to onboard one or two more.  \n- Provide ambassadors with resources to assist in event planning, content creation, and community outreach.  \n\n## Expected Outcomes  \n- Creation of over **600 localized, high-quality educational content pieces** over 6 months.  \n- Delivery of two successful in-person community meetups involving practical onboarding.  \n- Sustained Telegram community growth with active participation and new user acquisition.  \n- Development of a network of ambassadors to continue Zcash advocacy beyond the grant period.  \n- Enhanced visibility and reputation of Zcash in Ukraine as a leading privacy payment solution.  \n\n## Budget  \nFor executing these activities, we request funding of **14 ZEC per month over 6 months, totaling 84 ZEC**.  \n\nThis budget covers:  \n- Production and moderation of a significant volume of localized content.  \n- Organization and facilitation of two offline meetups with all necessary logistics.  \n- Compensation and support for regional ambassadors helping to maintain and grow the community.  \n\n## Progress to Date  \nOur initiative has built strong momentum, highlighted in our regular monthly reports:  \n- [August 2025 Report](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ukraine-monthly-report-august-1-31-2025/52039)  \n- [September 2025 Report](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ukraine-monthly-report-september-1-30-2025/52281)  \n\nWe have successfully hosted offline events with practical user onboarding, produced an extensive volume of localized educational content, and expanded our social media presence to reach a growing audience of IT professionals, freelancers, activists, and crypto users.  \n\n## About Me  \nI am Beyond, a digital security and privacy educator, Web3 community organizer (Nym, Web3Privacy Now), and the coordinator of Zcash Ukraine since June 2025.  \nTwitter/X: [@Beyond_Karto](https://x.com/Beyond_Karto)  \n\nWith your support, we will continue to strengthen Zcash’s presence in Ukraine, onboarding hundreds of new users and establishing Zcash as a practical privacy tool in one of the world’s most challenging environments for financial freedom.  \n\nThank you for considering our application.\n",

      "description": "# Zcash Ukraine Regional Community Initiative  \n**Period:** December 2025 – May 2026  \n**Submitted by:** Beyond  \n\n\n## Introduction  \nDear Zcash Community,  \n\nMy name is Beyond, and I coordinate the Zcash Ukraine Regional Community Initiative. Since June 2025, we have been actively building a Ukrainian-speaking community focused on education, awareness, and practical adoption of private digital payments using Zcash.  \n\nThanks to community support and prior grants, we have achieved high activity levels with around **100 posts per month** across multiple platforms, successful offline events, and an engaged regional ambassador who has already contributed significantly to event organization. We now seek continued funding to further develop the initiative from December 2025 through May 2026.  \n\n## Why Ukraine?  \nUkraine remains in a complex situation of war, economic instability, and increasing financial surveillance. At the same time, more people are adopting cryptocurrencies as a safeguard for their assets and freedom.  \n\nZcash, as a protocol with strong privacy protections, is uniquely positioned to empower freelancers, activists, entrepreneurs, and everyday citizens by providing secure tools for financial autonomy that are resistant to censorship and surveillance.  \n\n## Project Goals (December 2025 – May 2026)  \n- Continue growing and scaling the Ukrainian-language Zcash community.  \n- Create and distribute high-quality localized educational content in Ukrainian.  \n- Onboard new users with a focus on practical usage of ZEC wallets.  \n- Host two offline meetups to deepen community engagement and facilitate onboarding.  \n- Support and expand the network of regional ambassadors to sustain growth.  \n\n## Work Plan  \n### Content and Communication (Monthly):  \n- Manage active presence on Telegram, Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn.  \n- Produce approximately **100 posts monthly**, including educational materials, news, threads, infographics, and video explainers.  \n- Conduct AMAs, Q&A sessions, polls, and interactive discussions on Telegram. \n- Thanks to your feedback, we will also expand community activity in chats and interactions with Zcash Global and ZecHub so that you can see the results of our work more clearly. \n\n### Offline Activities:  \n- Organize **two offline meetups** during the proposal period in Dnipro or other cities.  \n- Event formats include workshops, hands-on sessions, and practical Zcash wallet onboarding.  \n\n### Ambassador Support:  \n- Maintain engagement of at least one regional ambassador who has already supported past events, with potential to onboard one or two more.  \n- Provide ambassadors with resources to assist in event planning, content creation, and community outreach.  \n\n## Expected Outcomes  \n- Creation of over **600 localized, high-quality educational content pieces** over 6 months.  \n- Delivery of two successful in-person community meetups involving practical onboarding.  \n- Sustained Telegram community growth with active participation and new user acquisition.  \n- Development of a network of ambassadors to continue Zcash advocacy beyond the grant period.  \n- Enhanced visibility and reputation of Zcash in Ukraine as a leading privacy payment solution.  \n\n## Budget  \nFor executing these activities, we request funding of **1000 $ per month over 6 months, totaling 6000 $**.  \n\nThis budget covers:  \n- Production and moderation of a significant volume of localized content.  \n- Organization and facilitation of two offline meetups with all necessary logistics.  \n- Compensation and support for regional ambassadors helping to maintain and grow the community.  \n\n## Progress to Date  \nOur initiative has built strong momentum, highlighted in our regular monthly reports:  \n- [August 2025 Report](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ukraine-monthly-report-august-1-31-2025/52039)  \n- [September 2025 Report](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ukraine-monthly-report-september-1-30-2025/52281)  \n\nWe have successfully hosted offline events with practical user onboarding, produced an extensive volume of localized educational content, and expanded our social media presence to reach a growing audience of IT professionals, freelancers, activists, and crypto users.  \n\n## About Me  \nI am Beyond, a digital security and privacy educator, Web3 community organizer (Nym, Web3Privacy Now), and the coordinator of Zcash Ukraine since June 2025.  \nTwitter/X: [@Beyond_Karto](https://x.com/Beyond_Karto)  \n\n\n\nWith your support, we will continue to strengthen Zcash’s presence in Ukraine, onboarding hundreds of new users and establishing Zcash as a practical privacy tool in one of the world’s most challenging environments for financial freedom.  \n\nThank you for considering our application.\n",

      "description": "# **Proposal: Zcash x BlockchainUNN Conference 4.0 — Building the Future of Privacy in Africa**\n\n---\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nMy name is **Kenzo**, a passionate blockchain advocate, builder, and community organizer, dedicated to expanding **Zcash’s mission across Nigeria and Africa**. Alongside [**Treyx**](https://x.com/Treyx_Im), one of **Zcash Nigeria’s most outstanding ambassadors and ecosystem leaders**, we are championing this proposal to invite **Zcash** to partner with the **BlockchainUNN Conference 4.0 — Buildathon Hero**, happening on **November 8, 2025**, at **Ekpo Ref, University of Nigeria, Nsukka**.\n\nTogether with the **Zcash Nigeria team**, we have been working to introduce **privacy-preserving technologies**, **educate young developers**, and **build tools** that embody **Zcash’s vision of financial freedom and privacy for all**. This event offers an unprecedented opportunity to take that mission to **thousands of new minds — developers, students, entrepreneurs, and innovators from across Africa**.\n\n---\nSince its inception, **BlockchainUNN** has built a reputation as a transformative force in Nigeria’s blockchain education movement. The past three editions witnessed groundbreaking innovation — from decentralized apps tackling local remittance issues to youth-led projects that won regional hackathon prizes. Alumni of the conference have gone on to secure internships, grants, and startup funding across the African Web3 ecosystem.\n\nThe 2024 edition, *Code the Future*, hosted major industry players, and drew over **5000+ online viewers** via livestream. The event’s impact continues to ripple across campuses, inspiring student-led blockchain clubs and open-source contributions.\n\nFor **2025**, the conference returns stronger, merging technical education with innovation and creativity. The **Buildathon Hero** edition will emphasize cross-chain interoperability, privacy in decentralized finance, and responsible blockchain adoption in Africa. It will serve as a launchpad for collaboration between global blockchain networks and local African developers.\n\nBlockchainUNN’s unique format — combining hackathons, workshops, keynote sessions, and exhibitions — ensures **practical engagement** and **real project development**, not just theoretical discussions. This year, the organizing team expects record participation from **over 30 universities across Nigeria and neighboring countries**.\n\n---\n\n## **Why Zcash Should Be Involved**\n\n**Zcash** is the **largest privacy coin** in the cryptocurrency world — and a **symbol of what it means to protect digital freedom**.  \nAn event of this scale offers a **moment that Zcash cannot afford to miss**.\n\nProjects like **Arbitrum**, **Sui Network**, and **Lisk** have already participated in similar community-led hackathons, leveraging such platforms to grow developer interest and ecosystem awareness. **Now is the perfect time for Zcash** to take its rightful place in **Africa’s blockchain evolution**.\n\n### **Benefits of Zcash’s Participation**\n\n- 🌍 **Visibility** before thousands of builders and students passionate about blockchain technology.  \n- 🏕️ **Dedicated booth** where Zcash can host demos, distribute swag, and engage developers.  \n- 📢 **Media exposure** across livestreams, banners, press features, and post-event documentaries.  \n- 💡 **Direct community interaction** to inspire new African projects built on Zcash’s privacy technology.  \n- 🤝 **Collaboration opportunities** with developers interested in DeFi, payments, and cross-chain tools.\n\nThis partnership would mark a **turning point for Zcash in Africa**, strengthening its ecosystem and **introducing shielded transactions** to the region’s fast-growing builder base.\n\n---\n\n## **Proposed Zcash Partnership Support**\n\nWe’re requesting **$3,000 in support from Zcash** to power our joint participation.  \nThe funds will be allocated as follows:\n\n| **Item** |  | **Amount (USD)** |\n|-----------|------------------|------------------|\n| Booth setup, banners, and branded Zcash materials (T-shirts, stickers, flyers) | — | **$1,600** |\n| Developer workshop logistics (technical equipment, internet, hackathon support) | — | **$700** |\n| Travel, lodging, and coordination for Zcash Nigeria representatives | — | **$600** |\n| Post-event video documentation and follow-up community workshop | — | **$100** |\n\n---\n\n## **Zcash Builders Workshop**\n\nDuring the hackathon, our team will host a **Zcash Builders Workshop**, guiding participants through **hands-on development** with **Zcash’s privacy technology**, **shielded transactions**, and **integrations with modern blockchain frameworks**.\n\nThis session will **empower new African builders** to create **tools, dApps, and financial models** that embody **Zcash’s principles of security and privacy**.\n\n---\n\n## **Community Engagement & Experience**\n\nBeyond learning, we’ll make the **Zcash experience engaging and fun** — with:\n\n- 🧩 **Interactive demos**  \n- ❓ **Live Q&A sessions**  \n- 🎁 **Giveaways and creative challenges**  \n\nAll designed to make **privacy technology exciting and accessible**.\n\nThe **Zcash booth** will serve as a **vibrant hub** where students and developers can **experience Zcash firsthand**, **explore opportunities in the ecosystem**, and **connect with mentors**.\n\n---\n\n## **Impact**\n\nZcash’s presence will not only **amplify its visibility** but also **ignite a long-term wave of adoption in Nigeria** — a country known for its **fast-growing blockchain talent pool** and **entrepreneurial energy**.\n\nBy joining forces at **BlockchainUNN**, **Zcash** positions itself as a **leader in Africa’s next phase of blockchain innovation**.\n\n---\n\n[Images From past event](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/partnership-invitation-blockchainunn-conference-4-0-buildathon-hero/52527)\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nTogether, we can **inspire the next generation of privacy-first builders** and prove that **privacy is not just a feature — it’s freedom**.\n\n> **Let’s make history at BlockchainUNN 4.0.**  \n> **Zcash x BlockchainUNN: Building Africa’s Private Future.**",

      "description": "Background:\n\nI’m Elzz, a content strategist and researcher with over five years of experience in Web3, focused on simplifying complex blockchain concepts through relatable content and community engagement.\n\nI first built experience in the Solana ecosystem, where I saw how powerful clear communication can be for driving adoption. I later applied that experience in projects like Ice Open Network, Star Tower Chain, and SonicSVM, helping them grow through strong storytelling and active community building.\n\nIn recent months, I’ve been involved in the Zcash ecosystem, joining community calls, engaging on Discord and creating content around Zcash’s mission of privacy and financial freedom. Some of my work has already gained recognition from core community members like Josh Swihart and Zooko, which motivates me to take my contribution to the next level as a Zcash Ambassador.\n\nWhy\n\nZcash is a project with one of the strongest value propositions in crypto: privacy, but the way it’s often communicated can feel closed-off to newcomers. I believe adoption grows when people understand and people understand when the message is clear, simple and relatable.\n\nThat’s where I come in. As an ambassador, my motivation is to be a bridge: between technical depth and everyday language, between developers and the broader crypto audience and between Zcash and new regions like Nigeria, where the conversation around privacy is still only beginning.\n\nGoals\n\nContent: Create consistent, beginner-friendly content (threads, articles, visuals) that break down Zcash’s technology, updates and ecosystem activity in accessible ways.\n\nCommunity Voice: Host regular discussions and spaces focused on engaging both developers and non-technical community members.\n\nOnboarding: Actively welcome and guide newcomers, helping them find their place in the ecosystem. Also use my access to blockchain developers in my region to influence building on Zcash.\n\nRegional Presence: Represent Zcash in Nigeria, where crypto adoption is growing rapidly but privacy narratives are underrepresented.\n\nDeliverables \n1. Reach & Visibility\n\nAchieve at least 10,000 tweet impressions per month from Zcash-related content.\n\nMaintain steady month-over-month growth in engagement (likes, retweets, comments).\n\n2. Engagement & Community Connection\n\nHost 2 Twitter Spaces per month, maintaining at least 20 unique listeners on average.\n\nGet meaningful engagement (comments, questions, retweets) from known figures or active community members in the Zcash ecosystem.\n\nBuild an active base of users who consistently reply, quote, or engage with my Zcash content.\n\n3. Education & Awareness\n\nPublish 2 educational threads/articles per month simplifying Zcash topics (privacy, shielded txs, zk proofs, etc.).\n\nMeasure audience sentiment (through replies, comments, polls) showing that more users understand and can explain Zcash concepts after my content and Spaces.\n\nHost a micro meet-up monthly, with the aim of onboarding developers and crypto enthusiasts in my locality into Zcash.\n\n4. Ecosystem Impact\n\nDrive at least 5 new users per month to try a Zcash wallet or send their first shielded transaction.\n\nHelp increase mentions of Zcash across crypto discussions and communities outside its usual circles in my region.\n\n5. Reporting & Accountability\n\nProvide monthly progress updates (impressions, engagement, event highlights).\n\nSubmit a 3-month summary report with key metrics, screenshots and learnings for potential program renewal.\n\nMonthly Budget \nAmbassador Stipend - $500\nFreelance Content Support (Video editing & Graphics)- $200\nTwitter Premium Pro - $30\nCommunity Rewards & Activation - $100\nMicro-Meetup Fund - $170\nTotal -$1,000/ $3000 (3 months)\n\nConclusion\nI’m already doing the work, showing up, creating content and connecting with the Zcash community. As an ambassador, I will take that to the next level with consistency, visibility and dedication to the Zcash mission.\n\n\nContact Me\nTwitter/X: @CQ_Elzz\nTelegram: @CQ_Elzz\nDiscord: #the_elzz\nEmail: cq.elzzz@gmail.com",

      "description": "BACKGROUND OVERVIEW\n\nAs Zcash celebrates its 9th anniversary, this milestone presents an opportunity to turn celebration into purpose by empowering those who are most vulnerable when it comes to privacy and personal protection. Across many communities, orphans and vulnerable children are often exposed to risks such as identity misuse, online exploitation, and lack of financial control. Their personal information is frequently managed by institutions or others, leaving them unaware of how data privacy and digital safety affect their lives.\nZcash stands for financial privacy, freedom, and dignity values that extend far beyond cryptocurrency. This project, “Protect Their Future: Zcash Privacy Awareness for Orphans,” will bring Zcash’s mission directly into an orphanage setting through an interactive, one-day educational and celebratory event. By hosting the event within the orphanage center itself, Zcash will meet participants in their familiar environment, reducing logistical barriers and creating a warm, inclusive atmosphere. The day will combine learning, empowerment, and celebration, showing that Zcash doesn’t just talk about privacy, it lives it.\n\nObjectives:\n1. Teach orphans and caregivers the importance of digital and financial privacy.\n2. Introduce Zcash as a global leader in privacy-focused technology that protects individuals.\n3. Equip participants with practical digital safety habits for daily life.\n4. Celebrate Zcash’s 9th anniversary with a meaningful community outreach event.\n5.

By holding the event directly within the orphanage center, Zcash meets the community where they are making privacy tangible, relatable, and personal.\n2. This project transforms Zcash’s 9th anniversary into a celebration of compassion and empowerment.\n3. For these children, privacy means safety. For their caregivers, privacy means trust. For Zcash, it’s a chance to show that financial privacy and human dignity are inseparable.\nThis initiative proves that privacy is not just about code, it’s about care.\n\nConclusion:\n\nZcash’s 9th birthday is more than a celebration; it’s a statement of purpose. Through “Protect Their Future: Zcash Privacy Awareness for Orphans,” the Zcash community will demonstrate that privacy can be a tool for empowerment and protection especially for those whose voices are often unheard.\nBy investing under $2,000, Zcash can leave a lasting mark inside the orphanage on a day that teaches, celebrates, and uplifts, all under the banner of Privacy for All.\n\nFor more detailed analysis and more clarity: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KUBBVnWzNUHPLUpqjxrWm1ioLUHcrml2UFmMPAiCSRk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.swyotvk2h3pz",

      "description": "## Overview\n\nDuring the recent hackathon, I, Tron, built ZEC Bounties (1st place), a working, semi-complete platform that allows the community to post, manage, and claim bounties whilst earning ZEC. The MVP demonstrated that the concept is feasible and can serve as a practical tool for rewarding community contributions.\n\nThis proposal aims to evolve ZEC Bounties from a hackathon project into a production-ready product hosted under “bounties.zechub.wiki” (or any other domain), complete with real-time updates, improved security, and a polished user experience.\n\n## Goals\n\n* Deliver a stable, secure, and feature-complete ZEC Bounties platform.\n\n* Integrate real-time communication so bounty updates appear instantly (no page refreshes).\n\n* Add user notification options — via Gmail and potential integration with ZECpublish or direct shielded memos.\n\n* Deploy the project under “bounties.zechub.wiki” (or any other domain) with a maintainable backend and production-grade database.\n\n* Establish a long-term foundation for updates and maintenance within the DAO.\n\n## Technical Stack\n\n* Frontend: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, shadcn, TailwindCSS)\n\n* Backend: Express.js with WebSocket integration\n\n* Database: PostgreSQL (production instance)\n\n* Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Render/Railway (backend + database)\n\n* Notifications: Gmail & ZECpublish / shielded memo messages (potentially)\n\n## Estimated Timeline (8 Weeks Total)\n\n| Week  | Milestone |  Deliverables |\n| :-------------: |:-------------|:-------------|\n| 1      | Codebase Refactor | Clean architecture, improved folder structure, and clearer logic. |\n| 2-4      | WebSocket Integration | Real-time bounty posting, updates, and claim notifications. |\n| 5      | Security & Validation | Harden backend routes, sanitize inputs, secure the database. |\n| 6      | Notification System      | Implement Gmail + ZECpublish / shielded memo messages for bounty creation and fulfillment (potentially). |\n| 7      | UI/UX Enhancements      | Visual consistency, responsive design, and interaction polish. |\n| 8      | Hosting & Deployment      | Production deployment to “bounties.zechub.wiki”, database migration, and testing. |\n\n\n## Hosting & Infrastructure\n\nThe platform will initially use free-tier hosting services to minimize cost while maintaining reliability:\n\n* Frontend: Vercel (Hobby Plan)\n\n* Backend: Render or Railway (Free Tier)\n\n* Database: Neon.tech or Supabase (Free Tier)\n\n* Domain: Existing zechub.wiki subdomain — bounties.zechub.wiki\n\nThese services are sufficient for the current scale.\n\nIf traffic increases or higher uptime becomes necessary, the hosting can later be upgraded to paid plans.\n\n## Budget & Compensation\n\n* Development rate: $50 /hour\n* Community discount: $23 /hour (54% reduction)\n\n* Hours per week: 40\n* Duration: 8 weeks (320 hours total)\n\nTotal cost:\n($23 × 320) / 223 ≈ 33 ZEC (@ $223/ZEC) (If it is lower than $223/ZEC, then it will be adjusted to the current value)\n\nThis discounted rate reflects my commitment to the Zcash ecosystem — I’m approaching this as a community contributor rather than an external contractor.\n\nThe total covers:\n\n* Full-stack refactor and optimization\n\n* Real-time update system (WebSockets)\n\n* Gmail + ZECpublish / shielded memo messages(potentially)\n\n* Backend security review\n\n* UI/UX touch-up and deployment setup\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZEC Bounties has already proven itself as a working MVP.\nThis proposal focuses on turning it into a reliable, real-world product that empowers the community to fund and reward meaningful work within the Zcash ecosystem.\n\nBy starting lean with free-tier hosting and community-minded pricing, we can deliver strong value immediately — and scale sustainably as adoption increases.\n",

      "description": "Hello ZecHub DAO,\n\nToday, I’d like to introduce a new Korean member to our DAO.\nHe’s an active advocate for Zcash on X (formerly Twitter) and has been a dedicated Zcash investor since 2017. (X address: https://x.com/Mindmovesme ; Followers: 1,095)\n\nBelow is an introduction from Zolder.\n________________________________________\n\nI’ve been working as a process engineer in the semiconductor industry for over 10 years, focusing on data analysis and precision process control to achieve reliability and accuracy in manufacturing.\n\nMy journey in crypto began in 2016. In 2018, I discovered that the chips I helped develop were actually being used in cryptocurrency mining machines delivered to customers — a moment that deepened my interest in blockchain technology. Since then, I’ve been actively involved in various Web3 projects such as NFT trading, The Sandbox, and Decentraland, and I’m currently engaging with the Mocaverse community by Animoca Brands, building connections with the global blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAs time goes on, security and privacy are becoming even more critical in our real-world society. I deeply resonate with Zcash’s philosophy of true individual freedom and transparency, and I’ve naturally become captivated by this ecosystem.\n\nI proudly call myself a “Zcash-shouting strong HODLer” — my X profile is dedicated to sharing insights and updates about Zcash. My ENS name, “Zolder” (Zcash + Holder), reflects my belief in Zcash as a trusted privacy network for storing value, and I’ve been consistently working to spread awareness and information about it.\n\nLately, I’ve been focusing on introducing practical features that users will increasingly need as the Zcash ecosystem grows — such as the Zashi wallet, Crosspay, and Swap functions. My goal is to communicate these topics in a simple and intuitive way so that the Korean Zcash community can continue to grow in a solid and constructive direction.\n\nAs an engineer with both technical and data-driven expertise — and a balanced perspective between the real and blockchain worlds — I hope to help make Zcash’s philosophy clear and meaningful to users worldwide, and to build an ecosystem where it’s truly used in practice.\n\nZheers 🥂\n",

      "description": "Hello!\n\n\nProject Description The Arabic Zcash Community Initiative is a dedicated effort to expand Zcash adoption, education, and development within the MENA (Middle East & North Africa) region. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between Zcash and Arabic-speaking users by providing localized educational resources, interactive learning tools, and direct developer support.\n\nProject Goals Continue building an active Zcash community in the MENA region. Educate Arabic speakers about Zcash’s privacy features and real-world applications. Increase the accessibility of Zcash-related content through localization and translation. Enhance user engagement through interactive activities, contests, and webinars. Encourage discussions on blockchain privacy and financial security within the region. To establish and grow an Arabic-speaking community for Zcash, ensuring wider adoption and understanding of privacy-focused blockchain technology in the MENA region. Foster collaborations between Zcash and regional blockchain developers to create new privacy-focused solutions.\n\nOur key achievements so far include:\n- Growing our community to 500 X followers and 200 Telegram members\n- Achieving 1,000+ views on most Twitter posts.\n- Consistently generating 200–400+ views per video/article.\n- Ranking many of our articles and videos on the first page of Google search results.\n- Developing and launching a dedicated Arabic Zcash website.\n- Publishing numerous Arabic articles, videos, and educational content, as well as hosting several community events.\n- Establishing two local partnerships and engaging in discussions with global projects such as Axelar, Zetachain, and others about collaborations involving Zcash.\n\n\nWhy MENA is Important for Zcash?\n\nEconomic Diversification and Innovation: Countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia are actively diversifying their economies beyond traditional sectors. The UAE, for instance, has implemented innovation-friendly regulatory frameworks that promote cryptocurrency adoption while ensuring consumer protection. This approach has attracted numerous crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs to the region.\n\nYouthful Demographics: Saudi Arabia, with approximately 63% of its population under the age of 30, boasts a young and tech-savvy demographic. This group is particularly open to experimenting with new financial technologies, including cryptocurrencies, making it a promising market for Zcash.\n\nRegulatory Support: The UAE continues to experience rapid growth in the crypto space, driven by a combination of regulatory innovation, institutional interest, and expanding market activity. Between July 2023 and June 2024, the UAE received over $30 billion in crypto, ranking the country among the top 40 globally in this regard and making it MENA’s third-largest crypto economy. The MENA region’s rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies, supported by favorable economic conditions and regulatory frameworks, underscores its importance for Zcash’s growth and outreach efforts.\n\nScope of Work:\n\nCollaborating with other local and regional communities to amplify our efforts and share resources and doing cross-events. Engaging with Arab exchanges to explore the listing of ZEC, which would help increase liquidity, accessibility, and demand across the region. Creating a dedicated website for ZcashArabia to serve as a hub for translated announcements, post original educational articles, and guides focused on Zcash and privacy. Over time, this platform will evolve to offer comprehensive Arabic-language courses for both users and developers, ensuring deeper technical understanding and adoption. Community Management Actively manage and moderate Zcash Arabia's X and Telegram channels. Engage with the community by answering questions, addressing concerns, and fostering discussions around Zcash. Maintain a welcoming and informative environment to attract and retain members. Content Creation & Localization Translation & Dissemination: Translate the latest Zcash news, announcements, and research papers and share them on X and Telegram.\n\nMonthly Content Deliverables\n2 articles covering Zcash technology, privacy features, and ecosystem developments)\n2 videos explaining Zcash use cases, updates, or tutorials on using Zcash securely. \n2 Twitter threads summarizing key topics, technical insights, or recent updates. \n3 infographics to simplify complex topics and enhance user understanding.\nCommunity Engagement Activities 1 Monthly Contest: Run engaging competitions such as webinars, AMA, quizzes, or user-generated content challenges to boost participation.\n\nExpected Impact: Establish a strong Arabic-speaking Zcash community. Increase awareness and adoption of Zcash within the MENA region. Increase number of new created wallets Provide educational resources tailored to Arabic speakers. Foster long-term engagement through interactive content and community-driven initiative\n\nPast work: https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcasharabia-report/50873\n\nRequested amount for 3 months : 2400 USD (800 USD per month)\n\nConclusion: Zcash Arabia will serve as a vital hub for Arabic speakers to learn, engage, and participate in the Zcash ecosystem. By combining content creation, community management, and strategic outreach, we aim to grow a thriving, informed, and active community dedicated to Zcash and its mission.\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "Background\n\nI am Joy Jhei, a Web3 content creator, social media manager, strategist and community builder, passionate about using storytelling to make crypto more human and relatable.\nI’ve worked with several blockchain and DeFi projects, producing high-value content that drives engagement and meaningful community participation. My background in social media management and video production enables me to create authentic, story-driven content that builds lasting community connections.\n\nWithin the Zcash ecosystem, I’ve been an active ZecHub contributor, supporting writing, creative design and collaborative work on community resources, among others. Recently, I produced the video “How Open-Source Communities like Zcash Keep Crypto Human,” which was well received on X and Discord for highlighting Zcash’s human-centered, open-source values.\n\n\n\nProject Overview\n\nBuilding on this foundation, this initiative aims to create a sustained and intentional storytelling strategy through consistent, narrative-driven videos that communicate Zcash’s story in an authentic, accessible and community-centered way.\n\nThe goal is to revive and transform ZecHub’s Instagram presence into a vibrant educational space; one that actively informs, inspires and connects with both new and existing members of the Zcash community.\n\nAs part of this initiative, I will personally appear in and host the videos, serving as the storyteller and on-camera voice for the project. Each video will feature me discussing different Zcash-related topics, from privacy education and open-source collaboration to community impact stories, making the content more relatable and human-driven.\n\nZecHub has established itself as a core educational hub, documenting and onboarding contributors worldwide. Yet, while its documentation and bounties thrive, its Instagram presence has gone quiet, revealing a storytelling gap. This project will bridge that gap, bringing ZecHub’s mission to life through consistent, human-focused video content that puts real faces and voices behind the Zcash story.\n\n\n\nExecution Plan\n\n1. Content Approach\n\n•\tCreate short-form videos featuring me as the on-camera presenter, simplifying complex Zcash topics and showcasing community stories through approachable dialogue.\n\n•\tIntegrate motion graphics, voiceovers and creative visuals to complement the storytelling.\n\n•\tMaintain a balanced content mix: educational, inspirational and update-driven.\n\n•\tUse storytelling and personal delivery to make Zcash approachable for newcomers and engaging for long-time supporters.\n\n2. Posting & Consistency\n\n•\tPublish 2–3 videos per week on Instagram, with highlights shared to X and Discord.\n\n•\tEstablish monthly content themes (e.g., privacy education, community voices, Zcash use cases) to ensure narrative cohesion.\n\n3. Community Management & Engagement\n\n•\tActively manage ZecHub’s Instagram, responding promptly to DMs, comments and inquiries.\n\n•\tHighlight community contributions and encourage participation through polls, Q&As and interactive story prompts.\n\n•\tCollaborate with ZecHub contributors and Zcash ambassadors to feature diverse community voices.\n\n4. Progress Tracking & Reporting\n\n•\tMonitor engagement metrics (views, shares, saves, comments, follower growth).\n\n•\tCollect audience feedback to refine content strategy.\n\n•\tProvide monthly progress reports with insights, performance data, and recommendations for continuous improvement.\n\n\nDeliverables (Over 3 Months):\n\n•\t18–24 short-form educational videos (2–3 per week) featuring me as the on-camera host, focused on Zcash topics and community stories.\n\n•\t3 monthly reports summarizing progress, analytics, and community engagement metrics.\n\n•\t1 revitalized Instagram page with consistent posting, engagement management, and audience growth tracking.\n\n•\t3 monthly content themes (e.g., privacy, open-source culture, community voices).\n\n•\tOngoing community interaction through polls, Q&A’s, comments and collaborations with ZecHub contributors.\n\n\nTimeline\n\nMonth 1 – Setup & Launch:\nStrategy Development. content planning, brand style setup, initial filming, and first video releases.\n\nMonth 2 – Execution & Growth\t\nContent Rollout\t(2–3 videos weekly), active engagement, cross-platform promotion and audience feedback collection.\n\nMonth 3 – Refinement & Reporting\nOptimization, continued content production, performance analysis, final report and recommendations for next phase.\n\n\n\n\nProposed Budget\n\n•\tSocial Media Management & Strategy – $450\n\nCovers the planning, scheduling, and execution of the overall social media strategy to ensure consistency and alignment with campaign goals.\n\n•\tVideo Production – $250\n\nIncludes scripting, recording, and editing of engaging video content to enhance brand communication and audience connection.\n\n•\tCreative Design – $100\n\nCovers the design of graphics, carousels and thumbnails to maintain a cohesive and visually appealing brand identity.\n\n•\tReporting & Tools – $50\n\nIncludes analytics tracking, scheduling tools and essential subscriptions for performance monitoring and campaign optimization.\n\nTotal (Per Month): $850\n\nProject Duration: 3 months\n\nGrand Total: $2,550\n\n\n\nExpected Outcomes\n\n•\tRevived and consistent ZecHub presence on Instagram.\n\n•\tIncreased community awareness and participation across social channels.\n\n•\tImproved alignment between educational content, contributors and outreach.\n\n•\tHuman-centered storytelling that strengthens Zcash’s brand and mission.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis project represents more than a social media refresh, it is a renewed commitment to amplifying Zcash’s values through authentic storytelling. By combining creativity, community insight and consistent execution, this initiative will transform ZecHub’s Instagram into a living narrative of what Zcash stands for; privacy, inclusion and human connection.\n\nOver the 3-month period, these videos will not only educate and engage but also inspire trust and belonging within the Zcash ecosystem. Through every story told and every voice amplified, this project will help the community see Zcash not just as technology but as a movement built by people and for people.\n\n",

      "description": "\n## Application Info\n\n**Owner:** @SafeguardLabs\n**Organization:** Safeguard Labs\n**Category:** Infrastructure\n**Requested Amount:** $9,850 USD\n\n## How we learned about ZCG\n\nWe learned about Zcash through some videos from the privacy community. When we started digging more into it we realized the community is pretty welcoming and the tech behind it is solid. Thats how we ended up here applying for a grant.\n\n## Project Lead\n\nIm a developer with background in blockchain - mainly Zcash, Algorand and Ethereum. I do smart contracts in Solidity and been working with privacy tech like Aleo (ZK proofs stuff).\n\nFor languages I use Rust, Golang, Python, Node.js and React. Built e-commerce platforms and cloud systems before. Right now also getting my OffSec certification because security is important for this kind of work.\n\n## Project Summary\n\nOk so basically we're building a platform that shows all the healthy Zcash nodes to the community. Think of it like Bitnodes but for Zcash. We want to show both Zebra and Zcashd nodes.\n\nThe way it works is we took the Ziggurat crawler (the one Equilibrium Labs made) and we modified it because the original config had some issues for what we needed. We added filters to clean up the data and show only the nodes that actually work.\n\n## The Problem\n\nRight now when you look at Zcash network data theres a lot of noise. You see nodes that dont work, Flux nodes mixed in, nodes that arent synced properly. The community cant really see the real health of the network.\n\nAlso with Zebra transition happening we need to track how many nodes are moving over. If we dont know the real numbers we could have a centralization problem without even knowing it.\n\nThe Zcash Foundation made changes so you can see health of your own node, but with this platform we can make sure the whole ecosystem is decentralized - like checking if nodes are all in one location or spread out.\n\n## What We Built So Far\n\nWe already have a working prototype at https://znodes.live\n\nWe forked the Ziggurat crawler from Equilibrium Labs and made several modifications:\n\n**New data structures we added:**\n- NodeInfo - stores info for each node like ip, port, user_agent, height\n- NetworkStats - network statistics with total nodes, zcashd count, zebra count, flux count\n- NodesResponse - the RPC response combining stats and node list\n\n**Filtering logic we implemented:**\n- Check if node responded to VERSION handshake (must have user_agent)\n- User agent must start with /MagicBean or /Zebra\n- Exclude anything with \"flux\" in user_agent\n- Exclude MagicBean 6.x (thats Flux not real Zcash)\n- Height must be above 2,000,000 (mainnet)\n- Height must be within ±50,000 of estimated tip\n\n**New RPC methods:**\n- getnodes - returns filtered node list\n- getstats - returns network statistics\n\n**Other changes:**\n- Added CORS support so frontend can connect\n- Changed initial connection to warn instead of panic if it fails\n- Added nodes snapshot that gets shared with RPC server\n\n## Why These Filters Matter\n\nWithout filters you see like 500+ nodes but most are Flux. Flux nodes run MagicBean 6.x and they announce themselves on Zcash network but theyre not really Zcash nodes - theyre a different project.\n\nWith our filters we get around 150-200 nodes which matches what ZecHub and other sources report as the real Zcash network size.\n\n## Solution Format\n\n- Web platform running 24/7 on a VPS\n- Open source code so anyone can verify the methodology\n- Can run locally too if someone doesnt trust the public site\n- Frontend dashboard showing cleaned data\n- Public API for other projects to consume\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Ziggurat crawler from Equilibrium Labs (base code we modified)\n- VPS for 24/7 running (need good specs because crawler maintains thousands of connections)\n- GeoIP database for map feature (to show where nodes are located)\n- Zcash protocols (zcashd and Zebra) for handshakes\n\n## Technical Approach\n\nWe use Rust because thats what Ziggurat is written in and it interacts directly with Zcash P2P protocol. The crawler makes handshake connections with nodes, we filter the data, and send it to a web interface.\n\nThe process:\n1. Crawler connects to DNS seeds and discovers nodes\n2. For each node we do VERSION handshake\n3. We extract user_agent, height, protocol version\n4. We classify as zcashd, zebra, or flux\n5. We filter out flux and nodes that dont meet criteria\n6. We send cleaned data to frontend via RPC\n\n## What We Still Need To Do\n\n- Add global map showing node locations (using GeoIP)\n- Improve frontend design to be more professional\n- Add support for manual node submission\n- Add historical data tracking\n- Better documentation\n\n## Upstream Opportunities\n\nSince we modified Ziggurat code we can make PRs back if we find bugs or improvements. Also if our crawler finds issues specifically affecting Zebra nodes we can share that with Zcash Foundation.\n\n## Budget\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n| VPS 12 months (32GB RAM, NVMe) | $1,450 |\n| Domain + Security | $200 |\n| Frontend Development | $4,000 |\n| Backend Engineering | $2,500 |\n| 12 month maintenance | $1,700 |\n| **Total** | **$9,850** |\n\n## Hardware Justification\n\nRunning a crawler needs higher specs than a regular node. We maintain thousands of concurrent connections to map the network, so we need 16-32GB RAM to prevent memory issues. Also need NVMe storage for fast data access.\n\n## Risks\n\n**Technical Risk (Low):** We already have working MVP so execution risk is low. About 50% of backend is done.\n\n**Operational Risk:** Crawlers can trigger abuse mechanisms at hosting providers. We budget for tolerant hosting and will use rate-limiting.\n\n## Privacy Considerations\n\nWe wont publish raw IP addresses of residential nodes. Geographic data will be aggregated to city/country level only. We want transparency without doxxing node operators.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n1. Dashboard launch with Zcashd vs Zebra visualization\n2. Greater than 99% uptime over 12 months\n3. Open source code published for community auditing\n\n## Startup Funding\n\nRequesting $5,000 upfront (about 50%) because:\n- Need to pay VPS for full year upfront\n- Frontend developer needs retainer to start sprint\n- Backend is already 50% done so we can move fast\n\n## Milestones\n\n**Milestone 1 - $2,425 - January 2026**\n- Production dashboard launch\n- Ziggurat crawler on VPS\n- Data visualizations (heatmap, node counts, zebra vs zcashd breakdown)\n- Public API release\n\n**Milestone 2 - $2,425 - January 2027**\n- 12 month service operations\n- Protocol compatibility updates for any network upgrades\n- Open source repository with documentation\n- Final network health report\n\n## Links\n\n- **Live MVP:** https://znodes.live\n- **Source Code:** https://github.com/Social-Mask-Labs/znodes\n- **Forum Post:** https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/znodes-explorer-real-time-network-map-for-zebra-zcashd/53548",

      "description": "# Znodes Explorer: A Privacy-First Network Map for Zcash\n\n## Background\n\nHello ZecHub, I am **Safeguard Labs**. I am deeply passionate about privacy, the hacking culture, and the entire blockchain ecosystem. My background is technical and diverse; I have \"proof of knowledge\" working with **Rust, Golang, Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.\n\nI have previously built marketplaces using cryptocurrencies for payments and developed systems for the **Algorand** ecosystem. I also have experience with **Aleo**, which reinforced my enthusiasm for zero-knowledge technologies.\n\nI am here because I find Zcash to be something beautiful and interesting. I want to contribute to this ecosystem by building a tool that can bring real value. I have already developed an MVP called **Znodes**, a website that uses a \"handshake\" process to discover new nodes. Currently, it functions as a Zcash node finder specifically for **Zebra** nodes. We are now ready to upgrade this to fully support **Zcashd** nodes as well.\n\nThis tool is essential for investors and the community to analyze the network's health: Is it centralized? Are nodes concentrated in one country? While Zcash provides transactional privacy, the health of the network itself should be transparent and public.\n\n## Why this is important?\n\nThe spark for this project came from a comment by a Zcash Foundation worker who stated that [visualizing the network is a \"great idea\"](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/where-are-all-the-zcash-nodes-exploring-a-simple-clear-view-of-the-network/53266). I investigated further and noticed that while there is curiosity about this, previous threads were closed, and no robust tool exists yet.\n\nI decided to take the initiative. I utilized the **Ziggurat crawler**, modified it, and created custom filters to build my own solution.\n\nThere is a lot of data and repositories out there, but no one is unifying them into a user-friendly tool like **Bitnodes** (but for Zcash). My project solves this. With my updated crawler, we can:\n\n* **Monitor Decentralization:** Prove that Zcash isn't a \"crypto scam\" but a robust, distributed network with many participants.\n* **Track the Migration:** Visualize the transition from **Zcashd** to **Zebra**, seeing in real-time how the ecosystem's behavior evolves.\n* **Ensure Stability:** Detect if the network is having node propagation issues.\n\n## Proposal\n\nI am requesting a grant of **$9,850** to fund 3 months of focused development to turn the MVP into a professional, fully-featured platform.\n\n### Key Features & Goals\n\n* **The Crawler:** We will improve the backend logic (based on Ziggurat) to discover both Zebra and Zcashd nodes efficiently.\n* **Privacy-Preserving Live Map:** We will implement a live map showing node locations. **Crucially**, this will only show the *country* or general control region. We will **not** doxx node operators; exact locations will remain private.\n* **Professional Design (UI/UX):** We will hire an external designer to create a \"White & Professional\" interface (utilizing a palette of black, strong blues, and grays). The goal is a clean platform with no ads, unlike Bitnodes.\n* **Node Trust System:** A backend system to classify nodes based on stability and uptime, giving a \"trust score.\"\n* **Manual Node Discovery:** A feature allowing users to manually add their nodes to the platform to speed up discovery.\n* **API for Developers:** A public API so other devs can use our node data for their own apps.\n* **Security Audits:** Ensuring the site does not keep logs, IPs, or cookies that could compromise user privacy.\n\n> **Budget Note:** I am currently using my personal Digital Ocean credits (student credits) to host the VPS, but I need those for other learning projects. This budget will cover dedicated VPS hosting, a premium domain, and maintenance.\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap & Milestones (3 Months)\n\n**Total Budget Request:** $9,850\n\n### Month 1: Infrastructure & Zcashd Integration ($5,000)\n* Payment for dedicated VPS and Domain.\n* Launch a secondary investigation node to analyze network behavior (solving the issue where some nodes receive info but don't send it).\n* **Core Task:** Full integration of **Zcashd** support into the crawler.\n* **Delivery:** A stable backend capable of seeing both Zebra and Zcashd nodes.\n\n### Month 2: Live Map & Visual Overhaul ($3,000)\n* Implementation of the **Real-Time Node Map** (Country-level precision).\n* UI/UX Development: Implementing the new professional, white/clean design.\n* Continued investigation of node behavior to refine the crawler's accuracy.\n\n### Month 3: Advanced Features & Polish ($1,850)\n* **Manual Node Adding:** Interface for users to submit nodes.\n* **Backend Classification:** System to identify stable vs. unstable nodes.\n* **API Release:** Documentation and endpoints for the public API.\n* **Security Audit:** Final check to ensure no data leaks (IPs/cookies).\n\n---\n\n## Links & Resources\n\n* **Live MVP:** [znodes.live](https://znodes.live)\n* **Source Code:** [GitHub - znodes](https://github.com/Social-Mask-Labs/znodes)\n* **Forum Discussion:** [Zcash Community Forum](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/znodes-explorer-real-time-network-map-for-zebra-zcashd/53548)\n\nThe MVP has already been running for **100+ hours** without issues. With this grant, we can take it to the next level.",

      "description": "NESTHUB comes from the need for a place where Web3 global professionals are being built and groomed in the city of Ibadan(the largest city in West Africa). As the first free physical developer training community in Ibadan, Nesthub is widely known as the leading developer education community among the tech community in Ibadan and has had a major influence on the growth of the members of the Web3 community in Ibadan. Nesthub has a lasting relationship with the Department of Computer Science, University of Ibadan(UI), Google developers on campus, UI, and similar relationships with 3 other universities in the southwestern part of Nigeria.\nIn Q2 2025, a couple of expert blockchain developers joined us to provide a highly curated, deep-dive session for our cohorts, which has helped our trainees gain a wide range of experience necessary for their journey. We have helped onboard blockchain developers for different blockchains like ICP and Stellar from our community.\nA few of our previous cohorts' pictures : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-aaq1lYgN-zIDui8CY9Xr-8DQnUbsqPw\n\n\nBefore founding Nesthub in 2024, young developers had very few accessible ways to learn the skills needed to build in Web3. Resources were scattered, unstructured, and often out of reach, creating a major gap between interest and real technical ability. Although new initiatives are beginning to create learning communities and provide hands-on guidance, they remain too limited to meet the growing demand for skilled blockchain developers. Nesthub has positioned itself as a solid bridge for young minds by expanding and simplifying these IRL programs, which is essential to equipping more young Nigerians with practical skills and open pathways into a rapidly growing global industry. It has also been observed that there are fewer educational initiatives in Nigeria concerning the topic of privacy solutions. It has also being realize thatost developers couldn't participate in hackathon (zypherpunk) involving privacy due to lack of knowledge. Most developers build products with little or no knowledge of how privacy works.\n\nNestHub plans to leverage its established community, relationships, and partnerships to deliver a structured, privacy-focused community education initiative in Q1 2026 through the month-long developer cohorts and monthly meetups.\nTwo events: 1 Developer Cohorts, and 1 meetup for Zcash:\n\nDeveloper bootcamp: January 2026\nMeetup: 31st January 2026\n\nRequested amount: $3500\n\n>Facility Costs (Internet, electricity, and Audio and Video equipment) → $3000; \n\n>Meetup → $500\n\nIf Approved, we plan to spread the word of zcash Privacy with this bootcamp. NWith a solid curriculum that has been drafted, we have decided to have 2 senior developers. We also plan to open the bootcamp to not just our student but to the general public with the necessary skillset who might be interested in understanding how privacy works. \n\n\nDeliverables:\n    - Host a month-long developer cohort on privacy focused solutions.\n    - Host a meetup focused on Zcash and Privacy\n    - pictures and videos taken during the events.\n\n\nIf you have any questions concerning this proposal \nPlease reach me @ Telegram: DreKal0 ",

But in those 2 days, I thought a lot about the progress of my project. I realized I have done a lot, and I really want to continue with it.\n\n### Update on progress\nI made the map, I added the map, and I updated the website.\nYou can see the code in the repository here: https://github.com/Jules0x-xyz/Znodes-Crawler-Zcash\n\n### My Goal\nI want to ask for a grant to improve the website and make a product that can be used by all the users of the Zcash ecosystem. **But before I ask for a grant, I want to receive all your feedback.**\n\nI saw the Zechub opinion of my project and you said that you need more feedback. Also, looking at the reasons why you rejected my previous proposal helps me a lot. I want to know specifically the reasons to make corrections and make a product that adapts to your feedback for a new proposal.\n\n### Specific Questions for You\nIn the videocall you made, I listened to someone saying that there exists a repository of a crawler, I heard the name is \"cruch\" or something like that but I made an investigation and I didn't find it. I am interesting to see more of that repository you mentioned.\n\n**Please, I want to listen to all of your comments.**\nI want to know the aspects that I need to clarify or the aspects I need to update to make another proposal.\n\nYou can write your questions here in this post:\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hello-zechub-responding-to-the-video-feedback-znodes-q-a/53742\n\nI am going to answer everything there.\n\nI know I said I wanted to leave this project or take some time, but the truth is I already have a big part done and I have a lot of anxiety/excitement to see this work. I want to achieve one of my first big contributions to Zcash.\n\nAlso, this project helps me distract myself and I feel it has a real purpose. I did this with a lot of effort and heart. I hope it doesn't bother you that I changed my mind and returned to work so fast.\n\n**I am here to receive all your comments.**\nYou can ask questions about the development, the form that I made the project, the internal aspects, or the social aspects. I know that all the members of this DAO have different skills that improve the management and the projects, and I want that feedback to make a bigger and better panorama :) .\n\n**Thanks for your time i wish i could receive a lot of feedback of you <3 ** ",

At the moment our X page (@ZcashGH) has over 300 followers.\n\nThe Goal is to continue building an active Zcash Ghana community across various cities in Ghana. Educate Ghanains about Zcash’s privacy features and real-world applications. Increase the accessibility of Zcash-related content through localization and translation. Enhance user engagement through interactive activities, contests, and webinars. Encourage discussions on blockchain privacy and financial security within Ghana and ensuring wider adoption and understanding of privacy-focused blockchain technology in Ghana and Africa at large. Foster collaborations between Zcash and regional blockchain developers to create new privacy-focused solutions.\n\nThe reason for this grant: We are asking for this grant to help us continue building the Zcash Ghana community through our various blockchain education and financial privacy activities which include content creations, educational gaming, meetups and workshops, as well as collaborate with other web3 communities, all these leading towards more adoption of Zcash protocol in Ghana. With this grant we will host monthly Zcash Ghana physical meetup, monthly X-Space event and monthly game challenge together with educational content posts.\n\n\nExpected Deliverables:\n1. One monthly Zcash Ghana in-person meetup\n2. One monthly Zcash Ghana x-space conversation\n3. Zcash related content posting on X (twitter)\n\nPast work: https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ghana-meetup-1-onboarding-to-zcash/51917\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/join-the-zcash-ghana-x-space-event-02-why-zcash-exploring-shielded-payments-business-potential/51648\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ghana-key-activities-update-december-2025/53793\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ghana-key-activities-update-november-2025/52859\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ghana-key-activities-update-october-2025/52438\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/join-the-maiden-zcash-ghana-x-space-event-this-sunday/51597\n\n\nRequested amount for 3 months: 4500 USD (1500 USD per month)\n\nConclusion: Zcash Ghana will serve as a vital hub for Ghanaians to learn, engage, and participate in the Zcash ecosystem.

      "description": "1. Context\n\nZecHub has become a central touchpoint for Zcash education, documentation, and community-driven contributions. Through its website, newsletter, wiki, and content initiatives, it has successfully lowered the barrier to learning about Zcash and enabled community members to contribute to the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, as Zcash adoption grows and education becomes increasingly important to the privacy narrative, the current contributor workflow shows structural limitations that reduce its ability to scale participation, distribution, and long-term contributor engagement.\n\nThis proposal outlines an evolution of ZecHub’s contributor model to better support identity-bound contributions, broader participation, and ecosystem-wide distribution, without fragmenting existing efforts.\n\n\n2. Current Contributor Model (Observed Limitations)\n\nAt present, contribution primarily occurs through task-based workflows using Dework. While functional, this model introduces several challenges:\n\n- No structured onboarding or verification:\nContributors can participate without prior education, alignment, or demonstrated understanding of Zcash.\n\n- Anonymous or low-commitment participation\nTasks can be completed by individuals with little long-term attachment to the Zcash ecosystem, including repeat or duplicate accounts.\n\n- Single-output task constraints\nMany tasks allow only one assignee, limiting the diversity, reach, and creative expression of educational outputs.\n\n- Centralized distribution\nCompleted work is typically published on ZecHub-owned platforms, reducing organic reach across social networks where crypto-native audiences already exist.\n\n- Limited contributor progression\nThere is no clear pathway for contributors to grow, specialize, or deepen their involvement beyond one-off tasks.\n\nThese constraints result in underutilized community capacity and missed opportunities for broader education and narrative distribution.\n\n\n3. Identified Need\n\nZcash requires:\n\n- Consistent, accurate education across public channels\n\n- Contributors who understand privacy, shielding, and protocol values\n\n- Distributed narratives that reach users where they already are\n\n- Participation models that reward long-term engagement over short-term task completion\n\nAn improved contributor framework should prioritize education, identity, and distribution as first-class components.\n\n\n4. Proposed Evolution of the Contributor Framework\n\nThis proposal recommends enhancing ZecHub’s contributor program through the following principles:\n\nA. Verified Contributor Onboarding\n\nIntroduce a structured onboarding process focused on:\n\n- Zcash fundamentals\n\n- Accurate information sources\n\n- Contribution standards\n\n\nVerification ties contributions to real social identities (e.g. Twitter/X, TikTok), reducing low-effort or duplicate participation.\n\n\nB. Contest-Based Educational Bounties\n\n- Shift selected educational tasks from single-assignee jobs to open contests.\n\n- Encourage multiple contributors to create content simultaneously.\n\n- Leverage contributors’ personal platforms for initial distribution.\n\n- Curate and feature high-quality outputs on ZecHub channels.\n\n\nThis approach increases both output volume and distribution reach.\n\n\nC. Participation-Based Incentives\n\nRecognize contributors for:\n\n- content creation\n\n- event attendance\n\n- community participation\n\nEncourage long-term involvement rather than isolated submissions.\n\n\nD. ZecHub as Curator\n\n- ZecHub maintains editorial standards and accuracy.\n\n- The community becomes the distribution engine.\n\n- Education spreads organically while remaining aligned with protocol values.\n\n\n5. Expected Outcomes\n\n- Higher-quality, privacy-aligned educational content\n\n- Increased visibility of Zcash across social platforms\n\n- Stronger contributor retention and accountability\n\n- A scalable contributor system aligned with decentralization principles\n\n\nA detailed framework outlining contributor onboarding, verification, participation incentives, and tracking mechanisms is available as a supplementary document for review here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1twbinsqSC6vLDmB-kctuAfq7VwdmGMU-BNVLVLaLqmE/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\n\nClosing\n\nThis proposal does not replace ZecHub’s existing role. It strengthens it. By evolving the contributor pipeline and distribution model, ZecHub can better support Zcash’s education needs while preserving cohesion across the ecosystem.\n",

      "description": "Zcash Ambassador Tenure Renewal Proposal\n\nName: Elzz\nRole: Zcash Global Ambassador\nTenure Covered: November 2025 – January 2026\n\nOver the past three months, my ambassadorship has focused on one core objective:\nmoving people from awareness of Zcash to actual usage and sustained participation.\n\nRather than relying solely on passive education or awareness-driven content, my work has centered on experience-led community building: combining consistent educational content, live conversations, creating low-friction entry points and hands-on onboarding that allowed people to see and use Zcash in practice.\n\nFrom micro-meetups and live Spaces to the #12DaysOfZECmas challenge and ongoing educational content, this tenure has demonstrated that adoption accelerates when people are invited to participate, not just observe.\n\nThis proposal outlines the impact of the work so far and why continuing this approach is important for the Zcash ecosystem moving forward.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Building & Onboarding\n\nThroughout the tenure, I hosted two (2) focused meetups designed around live onboarding rather than abstract explanations. These sessions emphasized:\n\n- Wallet setup and usage\n- Shielded transactions\n- Payments and swaps via Zashi\n- Cross-chain usage through the Near Intent bridge\n\n\nA consistent outcome across these meetups was the same moment of clarity: participants were often surprised by how simple and usable privacy felt once experienced directly. Many attendees continued engaging with the Zcash community afterward, contributing to ongoing discussions and activities.\n\n\n\nContent, Spaces & Collaborative Education\n\nAcross the three months, I maintained a steady cadence of educational content and live discussions, publishing multiple protocol-focused articles and hosting a total of five X Spaces during the tenure.\n\nThese Spaces were intentionally collaborative, including sessions with Zcash Nigeria, Zcash Ghana, and ecosystem builders like Shielded Mark of Shielded Labs. This helped broaden reach, connect regional communities and reinforce shared narratives around privacy, usability, and adoption.\n\nContent topics consistently focused on core Zcash principles: privacy, shielding, usability, and real-world application, and were often shaped directly by community questions and feedback. This created a feedback loop where curiosity informed education, and education led to participation.\n\n\n\nExperience-Led Community Activation:\n\n#12DaysOfZECmas Challenge \nOne of the most impactful initiatives during this tenure was the #12DaysOfZECmas challenge, executed in December.\nThe challenge was designed to move beyond awareness by encouraging daily, hands-on interaction with Zcash tools, particularly Zashi.\n\nParticipants were guided through activities such as:\n- Wallet setup\n- Shielded payments\n- Swaps and on-chain activity\n- Joining community events (calls and spaces)\n- Sharing real usage experiences publicly\n\nThe initiative generated strong community participation and demonstrated how effective experience-led onboarding can be for a privacy-focused protocol. It lowered psychological barriers, increased confidence, and created a shared moment of participation across the community.\n\nThe challenge gained ecosystem-wide visibility, including recognition in the then Zcash CEO Josh Swihart’s weekly update, validating the effectiveness of community-led, experience-driven adoption efforts.\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem Connectivity & Local Access\n\nBeyond community education, I focused on addressing practical access gaps within the Zcash ecosystem.\n\nDuring this tenure, I initiated direct outreach to Pajcash, a leading Nigerian on-ramp and off-ramp platform already active within the Solana ecosystem, to explore support for ZEC alongside existing fiat and crypto flows.\n\nFollowing this outreach, Pajcash began active work toward enabling direct ZEC on-ramp and off-ramp to Nigerian Naira bank accounts, with an MVP currently in progress.\nThis represents a meaningful step toward improving local accessibility of ZEC in a key emerging market.\n\n\n\nPast Reports\n\nA quick glance through my work so far can be found on the Zcash community forum via these links:\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/global-ambassador-elzz-november-2025-report/53601\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/global-ambassador-elzz-december-2025-report/54021\n\nhttps://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/global-ambassador-elzz-january-2026-report/54522\n\n\n\nNext Tenure Focus & Planned Deliverables\n\nMy focus for this tenure will be to consolidate the momentum built over the past three months and deepen hands-on participation within the Zcash ecosystem.\n\nA key priority is the execution of the 3-day contributor and onboarding workshop scheduled for February 16–18, which has been under active planning. This workshop is designed to lower entry barriers for contributors by clarifying contribution pathways, reinforcing accuracy standards, and helping participants move from interest to meaningful participation within the ecosystem.\n\nBeyond the workshop, ongoing efforts will continue to center around education, visibility, and real usage.\n\nDeliverables for the next tenure include:\n\n- Educational content (articles and short-form posts) focused on core Zcash concepts, tooling, and privacy narratives\n- Regular X Spaces for live education, ecosystem discussions, and community Q&A, including collaborative sessions where relevant\n- Continued hosting of onboarding meetups focused on practical Zcash usage (Zashi, shielding, cross-chain privacy)\n- Active community engagement and follow-up with newly onboarded members to support sustained participation\n- Continued outreach to ecosystem partners where opportunities improve access, usability, or local adoption\n\nThe objective is to continue translating curiosity into real usage and participation, using methods that have already proven effective within the Zcash community.\n\n\nBudget\n\nMaintaining previous budget of $1000/month = $3000 for three months (February, March, April 2026)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis tenure showed that Zcash adoption accelerates when education is paired with experience and community is built through participation.\n\nThrough consistent content, collaborative Spaces, hands-on meetups, and initiatives like #12DaysOfZECmas, this work helped lower barriers to privacy and turn interest into real usage.\n\nBy listening closely to community signals, collaborating across regional Zcash communities, and emphasizing practical onboarding through tools like Zashi and the Near Intent bridge, these efforts strengthened confidence, understanding and engagement. Renewing this ambassadorship allows this momentum to continue and compound, building on proven methods that are already working.\n\nI’m grateful for the opportunity to continue serving the Zcash community and contributing to its long-term growth.",

As I spent more time in the Discord and ecosystem conversations, I realized I wanted to do more than just participate passively. I wanted to contribute in meaningful ways and help amplify the mission Zcash stands for.\n\nMy Contributions to Date:\n\n∙9th Anniversary of Zcash: I created a video celebrating Zcash’s milestone, showcasing the project’s impact and evolution\nhttps://x.com/i/status/1983120006159446380\n\n∙ZecHub Community Challenge: Actively participated in community challenges like 12daysOfzecmas, creating content and engaging with fellow community members\n\n∙Community Engagement: Regular attendance at Discord calls and meetings, building relationships with community members and learning from ecosystem contributors\n\n∙Organic Advocacy: Sharing Zcash’s message on X and educating others about the importance of financial privacy\n\n.Three weeks SMM and UGC for Zechub's TikTok and Instagram \n\n\n\nTHE REACH GAP\n\nZecHub is thriving on X as the educational hub for zcash, but the tiktok and Instagram pages are dormant - no content, no engagement, no growth.\n\nThe missed opportunity: These platforms reach entirely different audiences - people new to crypto, those unaware of Zcash, and younger demographics who consume short-form video content.\n\nThe urgency: Crypto creators are emerging on these platforms now. Every day we wait, competitors claim the space and define the narrative around privacy and blockchain.\n\nWe need to establish zechub as the authority on privacy education before it’s too late. TikTok and Instagram are essential channels to spread Zcash awareness to millions who need financial privacy but don’t know it exists yet.\n\n\n\nTRIAL PERIOD RESULTS (3 WEEKS)\n\nOver the past three-week testing period, I revitalized ZecHub’s presence on TikTok and Instagram with consistent, high-quality educational content.\n\nContent Delivered\n\nJanuary content calendar \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/16fo2Pb0X8UgRZRkLglodMy6SKC1fl7Cs6fc6inQ7M9Y/edit?usp=drivesdk \n\nTotal Videos Posted: 9 videos\n\t\nPerformance Metrics\n0ver 2.7k views\n55 profile Visits \n\nInstagram\n\n∙Starting Followers: 79\n∙Current Followers: 88\n\nTikTok\n\n∙Starting Followers: 36\n∙Current Followers: 43\n\nMetrics file\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vp5kKFf3zCsgY1zSdcxnLhe9CPMyCOdY\n\n\nKey Achievements\n\n.Established consistent posting schedule (3x per week)\n∙Created foundational educational content for newcomers\n∙Improved performance over previous account activity\n∙Built initial community engagement\n∙Directed attention and traffic to  zechub.wiki\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nAs ZecHub’s Social Media Manager and Content Creator, I will handle the complete content lifecycle across TikTok and Instagram:\n\nContent Strategy & Planning\n\n∙Develop monthly content calendars aligned with ZecHub’s educational mission\n\n∙Identify trending topics in crypto/privacy/blockchain to capitalize on\n\n∙Create content strategies to grow followers and convert them into active Zcash contributors\n\n\nContent Creation\n\n∙Write scripts for educational videos (45-60 seconds)\n\n∙Shoot and film all video content\n\n∙Edit videos with professional quality (graphics, captions, transitions)\n\n∙Create supplementary content (carousel posts, stories, reels)\n\n\nContent Distribution & Optimization\n\n∙Post content consistently (3 videos per week)\n\n∙Optimize posting times for maximum reach\n\n∙Cross-post strategically between platforms\n\n\nCommunity Engagement & Growth\n\n∙Reply to comments and DMs to build community\n\n∙Engage with crypto and Zcash-related pages and influencers to boost reach\n\n∙Participate in trending conversations within the crypto/privacy space\n\n∙Amplify ZecHub team members and community voices\n\n\nContent Repurposing\n\n∙Clip and edit interviews or appearances by ZecHub and Zcash team members\n\n.Repurpose long-form content from community members into short, viral-friendly clips\n\n∙Create highlight reels from Zcash events, podcasts, and announcements\n\n\nReporting & Analytics\n\n∙Track key metrics (followers, engagement rate, reach, profile visits, link clicks)\n\n∙Provide monthly performance reports\n\n∙Adjust strategy based on data insights\n\n\n\n\nSUCCESS METRICS\n\n∙\t Follower growth\n∙\tVideo views and reach\n∙\tEngagement rate (likes, comments, shares, saves)\n∙\tProfile visits and link clicks\n\n\n\n\nLONG-TERM MISSION\n\nTransform ZecHub’s social media into:\n∙The entry point for newcomers learning about Zcash on these platforms \n\n∙The reference hub for crypto newbies on practical guides and tutorials\n\n∙The community amplifier showcasing real people and real use cases\n\n∙The growth engine converting followers into active Zcash contributors\n\n\n\n\nCOMPENSATION & RESOURCES\n\nMonthly Compensation\n\nI propose to continue at the current compensation rate established during the trial period: $85 per video\n3 videos per week\n12 videos per month \n$85  X 12 = $1020 per month\n\nContents Tools\n\nTo maintain professional production quality, I request coverage for the following software subscriptions:\n\n∙Video Editing Software: Adobe Premiere pro\n\n.Motion graphics: Adobe aftereffects\n\n∙Carousel Designs: Adobe photoshop/illustrator\n\nAll apps included in adobe suite subscription of $69 per month \n$69 X 3 months = $207\n\nGrand Total\n\nMonthly: $1089\nFeb-April 2026:$3267\n\n\n\n\nACTION\n\nMoving forward, I will continue delivering 3 high-quality videos per week while expanding into more advanced topics and ecosystem highlights.\n\nFebruary content calendar \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwd3WniLCJ8Jv7hLYBlTGAIcGlZR8d0PjyVEiqs7Ql0/edit?usp=drivesdk \n\n\nReporting and Accountability\n\nAt the end of each month, I will submit:\n\n1.Performance Report including:\n\n∙Follower growth metrics\n∙Engagement analytics\n∙Top-performing content analysis\n∙Insights and learnings\n\n2.Next Month’s Content Calendar including:\n\n∙12 video topics and scripts\n∙Strategic rationale for content mix\n∙Any special campaigns or initiatives\n\nThis ensures transparency, allows for community and DAO feedback to keep content strategy aligned with ZecHub’s evolving priorities.\n\n\nThank you for your consideration.

      "description": "OVERVIEW: This proposal requests retroactive compensation for the month of January, during which I continued maintaining the Zcash Luma calendar despite the absence of active funding.\n\nMy previous proposal was structured for renewal this year, and due to an oversight on my part, I did not formally submit the renewal before the start of the new cycle. Under the assumption of continuity, I continued performing the role throughout January.\n\nAs a result, the calendar remained active and consistently maintained during that period without an active funding agreement in place.\n\nWork Completed in January: Throughout January, I continued to:\n\n- Add and update ecosystem events\n\n- Verify dates, links, and time zones for accuracy\n\n- Create and update event visuals and graphics\n\n- Coordinate with community members for event submissions\n\n- Maintain formatting consistency and categorization\n\nThere was no interruption in calendar updates or ecosystem visibility during the month.\n\nIMPACT\n\n- Weekly updates were maintained throughout January\n\n- Community, governance, and development events were published and verified\n\n- Visual assets continued to be created and updated\n\n- The calendar remained organized, accurate, and accessible\n\n- The ecosystem experienced no gap in event coordination or discoverability.\n\nFunding Request: I am respectfully requesting retroactive compensation for January only, at the previously approved monthly rate of $110.\n\nAccountability & Process Improvement: I take full responsibility for not submitting the renewal proposal before the start of the new funding cycle. While the continuation of work was done in good faith and aligned with prior responsibilities, I acknowledge that the formal renewal should have been completed in advance.\n\nTo prevent similar situations in the future, I will:\n\n- Track proposal timelines and renewal dates more carefully\n\n- Submit renewal requests prior to the end of each funding cycle\n\n- Maintain clearer documentation of active funding periods\n\n- My goal is to ensure full transparency, proper process alignment, and continued reliability in this role.\n\nConclusion: Maintaining an accurate and visually organized Zcash Luma calendar supports ecosystem coordination, event visibility, and community participation. Although the formal renewal was delayed, the work in January continued uninterrupted.\n\nI appreciate the community’s consideration of this retroactive request and remain committed to maintaining a reliable and professional calendar for the Zcash ecosystem.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

      "description": "I am SpeedFox, an active contributor within the Zcash ecosystem and seek to formalize my involvement through DAO membership.\n\n1. Ecosystem Contributions\n\nMy contributions span multiple domains that strengthen both technical infrastructure and community engagement:\n\na) Knowledge Infrastructure\n\nI have contributed to the development and improvement of ZecHub (https://zechub.wiki), supporting structured documentation and educational resources.\n\nClear, accessible documentation is critical in a privacy-focused protocol like Zcash, where concepts such as shielded transactions, key management, and node operations require careful explanation. My contributions help lower onboarding friction for developers and users.\n\nb) Creative & Educational Media\n\nBeyond documentation, I have contributed graphics design and short-form video content to enhance educational outreach and ecosystem visibility.\n\nHigh-quality visual communication is essential for:\n\n - Simplifying complex cryptographic concepts\n - Increasing social engagement\n - Supporting campaign initiatives\n - Strengthening brand consistency within the ecosystem\n\nThis aligns with long-term community growth objectives.\n\nc) Infrastructure Support\n\nI recently began operating:\n\n - A full Zcash node\n - A Lightwalletd instance\n\nBy running core infrastructure, I contribute directly to:\n\n - Network decentralization\n - Transaction relay robustness\n - Developer and wallet ecosystem reliability\n - Reduced dependency on centralized infrastructure providers\n\nInfrastructure operators are foundational to protocol resilience, particularly in a privacy-preserving network where decentralization is a core value proposition.\n\n\n2. Strategic Alignment with DAO Goals\n\nMy contributions align with key DAO priorities:\n\n - Decentralization — Running full node infrastructure\n - Education & Adoption — Contributing to ZecHub documentation\n - Community Growth — Visual and media support\n - Technical Depth — Hands-on experience operating Zcash infrastructure\n\nThis reflects not just passive participation but operational commitment.\n\n3. Forward-Looking Intent\n\nDAO membership would allow me to:\n\n - Participate more formally in governance discussions\n - Support technical and educational initiatives\n - Continue strengthening ecosystem infrastructure\n - Collaborate on tooling, documentation, and community-driven development\n\nMy objective is long-term contribution, not symbolic affiliation.\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "I am SpeedFox, an active contributor within the Zcash ecosystem and seek to formalize my involvement through DAO membership.\n\nEcosystem Contributions\nMy contributions span multiple domains that strengthen both technical infrastructure and community engagement:\n\na) Knowledge Infrastructure\n\nI have contributed to the development and improvement of ZecHub (https://zechub.wiki), supporting structured documentation and educational resources.\n\nClear, accessible documentation is critical in a privacy-focused protocol like Zcash, where concepts such as shielded transactions, key management, and node operations require careful explanation. My contributions help lower onboarding friction for developers and users.\n\nb) Creative & Educational Media\n\nBeyond documentation, I have contributed graphics design and short-form video content to enhance educational outreach and ecosystem visibility.\n\nHigh-quality visual communication is essential for:\n\nSimplifying complex cryptographic concepts\nIncreasing social engagement\nSupporting campaign initiatives\nStrengthening brand consistency within the ecosystem\nThis aligns with long-term community growth objectives.\n\nc) Infrastructure Support\n\nI recently began operating:\n\nA full Zcash node\nA Lightwalletd instance\nBy running core infrastructure, I contribute directly to:\n\nNetwork decentralization\nTransaction relay robustness\nDeveloper and wallet ecosystem reliability\nReduced dependency on centralized infrastructure providers\nInfrastructure operators are foundational to protocol resilience, particularly in a privacy-preserving network where decentralization is a core value proposition.\n\nStrategic Alignment with DAO Goals\nMy contributions align with key DAO priorities:\n\nDecentralization — Running full node infrastructure\nEducation & Adoption — Contributing to ZecHub documentation\nCommunity Growth — Visual and media support\nTechnical Depth — Hands-on experience operating Zcash infrastructure\nThis reflects not just passive participation but operational commitment.\n\nForward-Looking Intent\nDAO membership would allow me to:\n\nParticipate more formally in governance discussions\nSupport technical and educational initiatives\nContinue strengthening ecosystem infrastructure\nCollaborate on tooling, documentation, and community-driven development\nMy objective is long-term contribution, not symbolic affiliation.\n\nThank you.",

Bring visibility to DAO and SubDAO, onboard new potential contributors as Zcash users. It also helps users quickly identify which server they are visiting and give someone the opportunity to receive in ZEC.\n\nFor this contest, the prize amount donated by SubDAO will be 250 JUNO from the treasury plus an amount in ZEC that will be requested for donations on free2z and in the community.\n\n* Accept donations in Zcash Transparent via this address: \n#### t1Z28Y5cL5RyQD3tjFmjsmcp6sQ5aQCeDNQ \n\n\n## * The amounts donated above 10 ZECs will be returned half to the DAO treasury and the other half to SubDAO for community activations and task creation.\n\nThe donated amounts will be updated on my twitter: https://x.com/pedamerico\n\nThe banner animation or illustration may or may not contain a Zcash logo with a creative animation that shows the power of the community and the values that Zcash carries in its mission. There may be ZecHub logos involved and other community projects like ZK A/V or MFZ, but it is not mandatory to have a logo, the original focus should be on Zcash as Technology, Community, Human Rights, privacy and freedom.\n\nVoting for Banners will be done by DAO and SubDAO Members, with each person having the same voting weight.\n\nThe competition will start from the approval of the proposal until June 25th. The winner will be announced in July with the Banner uploaded to the server.\n\n\n# Banner Guidelines\n\n- image or GIF of at least 960x540 pixels with an aspect ratio of 16:9.\n\n- Keep the top first 48 pixels of the image free of too much information. This way, your server title will be easy to read for your community.\n\n- Use a GIF that represents Zcash.\n\n- Doing something beautiful and harmonious is important to make our home more beautiful and pleasant for new visitors.",

At the initial stage I helped to design isometric assets for the zechub.wiki website and eventually I will join the My First ZCash team to work on illustrations for the workbook, I also designed the retro themed cover design for the ZecHub X page and just very recently designed a poster for a ZecHub partnership with Secret. \n\nI would like to work on poster designs, page layouts, illustrations or any design assets that helps the DAO at large; the retro themed wallets for instance.

      "description": "\nObjective:\nThe purpose of this proposal is to request the transfer of 3 ZEC to the transparent address of the same Design SubDAO Wallet to hold a viral video contest, encouraging the creation of content about the book \"My First Zcash\".\n\nThe goal is to promote knowledge about Zcash in a creative and engaging way, focused on the Zcash community.\n\nContest Format:\n\nTheme: The contest will be based on the creation of short videos for social networks about the book \"My First Zcash\".\nVideo Length: The video must have a minimum length of 30 seconds and a maximum of 1 minute.\nPublishing Platform: Participants must post the videos on X, using the hashtags #MyFirstZcash and #Zcash.\nParticipants: The contest will be open to all members of the Design SubDAO, as well as any member of the Zcash community.\nVideo requirements: Since the book has not yet been translated, the videos must be focused on the English language. Videos with audio in another language will be accepted, with subtitles translated into English.\n\nPrizes:\nThere will be 3 winners divided into the following categories: most viral video, best editing, best creativity. The amount raised will be divided, with a limit of 15 ZECs (5 ZECs for each winner). The remainder will be sent to the orchard pool for the DAO treasury.\n\nTransparency:\nTo ensure transparency in the donation and prize process, we will disclose the transparent address of the SubDAO (where the value of 3 ZECs will be allocated after the proposal is approved), allowing the community to contribute the remaining 12 ZECs to fund the contest prizes.\n\nCommitment:\nI commit to developing all the graphic communication necessary for the campaign, ensuring that the contest is attractive and well-publicized, increasing community participation and engagement. The contest and voting end date will be announced only when it is ready and posted.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI believe that this contest will not only stimulate the creativity of the participants, but will also promote the book \"My First Zcash\", contributing to the education and dissemination of Zcash. We thank you for considering this proposal and hope to count on the support of the Design SubDAO.\n\nBest regards, Iogy.\n\nhttps://www.massadoption.org/projects",

      "description": "### Overview\n\nAs we approach the new year, I recognize my responsibility in moving forward, particularly since I was instrumental in creating the Zechub subDAO as well. With Zcash Brazil having its own design team, Spain and other communities actively participating in Dework, and given that Zechub has its own design team, we no longer need to manage the SubDAO's treasury or keep it operational.\n\nI propose the transfer of the remaining treasury balance from the Design SubDAO to the main Zechub DAO. This transfer aims to consolidate resources and ensure efficient management of funds within the Zechub ecosystem.\n\n### Current Treasury Details\n- **Remaining Balance in Design SubDAO**: 19.04 ZECs\n- **Pending Payment for Last Task**: 2.5 ZECs (to be disbursed in 2025)\n- **Total Amount to Transfer**: 16.54 ZECs (after accounting for the final payment)\n\nThe last task involves the creation and delivery of a tutorial titled \"Installing Zebrad Node on Linux.\" This task is scheduled for delivery on November 29, 2025, and will subsequently be posted on YouTube. For reference, the task details can be found here: [Task Link](https://app.dework.xyz/zechub-2424/project-space?taskId=a3302cfb-f3b7-4b78-863b-c05017a5d083).\n\n### Transfer Process\nIf this proposal is approved:\n- The receiving address for the Zechub DAO will be provided by Squireel.\n\nu1rl2zw85dmjc8m4dmqvtstcyvdjn23n0ad53u5533c97affg9jq208du0vf787vfx4vkd6cd0ma4pxkkuc6xe6ue4dlgjvn9dhzacgk9peejwxdn0ksw3v3yf0dy47znruqftfqgf6xpuelle29g2qxquudxsnnen3dvdx8az6w3tggalc4pla3n4jcs8vf4h29ach3zd8enxulush89\n\n- The transfer will be executed by @Iogy from Zcash Brazil.\n- Upon completion, the transaction hash and confirmation of receipt will be attached for transparency and verification.\n\nThis transfer will close out the Design SubDAO treasury and redirect the funds to support broader Zechub DAO initiatives. \n\nWe recommend approval to streamline operations and optimize resource allocation.
